    <h1> Palmer Dabbelt's Blog </h1>
    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170807-introduction.html">August 07, 2017: All Aboard, Part 0: Introduction </a> </h2>
    <p>I&#x27;m Palmer Dabbelt, a software engineer at SiFive and a maintainer of
various RISC-V ports. I&#x27;ve been working with the RISC-V ISA for a few
years, and it&#x27;s finally starting to get ready for prime-time. We&#x27;re not
yet upstream in Linux or glibc, but hopefully by the end of the year
we&#x27;ll have the core set of system software in the relevant upstream
repositories &ndash; at which point distributions can begin porting to RISC-V
and users can begin using our software. I started working with RISC-V
before the user ISA had been finalized (at least v2 of the user ISA, the
real one :)) and it&#x27;s almost a bit scary how real things have gotten
over the last few years.</p>
<p>While I think the core of the RISC-V software ecosystem is in decent
shape, I have noticed that it&#x27;s very difficult for users to get up to
speed with RISC-V software due to a lack of non-code content. While
SiFive has dramatically improved the documentation and user experience,
there doesn&#x27;t appear to be good concrete, long-form technical content
about the RISC-V software ecosystem that&#x27;s easy to find on a search
engine. As a result, it&#x27;s very hard for people who are new to RISC-V to
find solutions for their problems. The mailing list has been picking up
this slack for the last year or so, but as the community continues
expanding, the burden of relying on users to ask questions is becoming
too high.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll be posting a blog entry every Monday for the foreseeable future.
The articles will be aimed at both users and prospective developers of
the various RISC-V ports that I help maintain. I&#x27;ll draft these posts so
that they are interesting to read out-right, a good reference for new
members of the community, and to be easy to search for on Google.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll see you all next Monday at our first stop: the <code>-march</code>, <code>-mabi</code>,
and <code>-mtune</code> argument to RISC-V compilers!</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170814-march_mabi_mtune.html">August 14, 2017: The `-march`, `-mabi`, and `-mtune` arguments to RISC-V Compilers </a> </h2>
    <p>Before we can board the RISC-V train, we&#x27;ll have to take a stop
at the metaphorical ticket office: our machine-specific GCC command-line
arguments. These arguments all begin with <code>-m</code>, and are all specific to
the RISC-V architecture port. In general, we&#x27;ve tried to match existing
conventions for these arguments, but like pretty much everything else
there are enough quirks to warrant a blog post. This blog discusses the
arguments most fundamental to the RISC-V ISA: the <code>-march</code>, <code>-mabi</code>, and
<code>-mtune</code> arguments.</p>
<p>One advantage of having a functional GCC port for a long time
before we stabilized SiFive&#x27;s interfaces is that we can have a well thought-out
command-line interface to the RISC-V C and C++ compilers. This allows us
to expose the same command-line interface from both the GNU tools (GCC
and binutils) as well as the LLVM tools, as well as avoid the need for
users to directly pass flags to the assembler or linker via the
compiler&#x27;s <code>-Wa</code> and <code>-Wl</code> arguments.</p>
<p>To ensure that the RISC-V compiler command-line interface is easy to extend in the future, we
decided on a scheme where users describe the RISC-V target they are
trying to compile for using three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-march=ISA</code> selects the architecture to target. This controls which
instructions and registers are available for the compiler to use.</li>
<li><code>-mabi=ABI</code> selects the ABI to target. This controls the calling
convention (which arguments are passed in which registers) and the
layout of data in memory.</li>
<li><code>-mtune=CODENAME</code> selects the microarchitecture to target. This
informs GCC about the performance of each instruction, allowing it
to perform target-specific optimizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>-march</code> Argument
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The <code>-march</code> argument is essentially defined by the RISC-V user-level
ISA manual. <code>-march</code> controls instruction set from which the compiler is
allowed to generate instructions. This argument determines the set of
implementations that a program will run on: any RISC-V compliant system
that subsumes the <code>-march</code> value used to compile a program should be
able to run that program.</p>
<p>To get a bit more specific: Version 2.2 of the RISC-V User-Level ISA
defines three base ISAs that are currently supported by the toolchain:</p>
<ul>
<li>RV32I: A load-store ISA with 32, 32-bit general-purpose
integer registers.</li>
<li>RV32E: An embedded flavor of RV32I with only 16 integer registers.</li>
<li>RV64I: A 64-bit flavor of RV32I where the general-purpose integer
registers are 64-bits wide.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these base ISAs, a handful of extensions have been
specified. The extensions that have been specified and are
supported by the toolchain are:</p>
<ul>
<li>M: Integer Multiplication and Division</li>
<li>A: Atomic Instructions</li>
<li>F: Single-Precision Floating-Point</li>
<li>D: Double-Precision Floating-Point</li>
<li>C: Compressed Instructions</li>
</ul>
<p>RISC-V ISA strings are defined by appending the supported extensions to
the base ISA in the order listed above. For example, the RISC-V ISA with
32, 32-bit integer registers and the instructions for multiplication
would be denoted as <code>RV32IM</code>. Users can control the set of instructions
that GCC uses when generating assembly code by passing the lower-case
ISA string to the <code>-march</code> GCC argument: for example <code>-march=rv32im</code>.</p>
<p>On RISC-V systems that don&#x27;t support particular operations, emulation
routines may be used to provide the missing functionality. For example
the following C code</p>
<pre><code>double dmul(double a, double b) {
  return a * b;
}</code></pre>
<p>will compile directly to a FP multiplication instruction when compiled
with the D extension</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv64imafdc -mabi=lp64d -o- -S -O3
dmul:
  fmul.d  fa0,fa0,fa1
  ret</code></pre>
<p>but will compile to an emulation routine without the D extension</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv64i -mabi=lp64 -o- -S -O3
dmul:
  add     sp,sp,-16
  sd      ra,8(sp)
  call    __muldf3
  ld      ra,8(sp)
  add     sp,sp,16
  jr      ra</code></pre>
<p>Similar emulation routines exist for the C intrinsics that are trivially
implemented by the M and F extensions. As of this writing, there are no
A routine emulations because they were rejected as part of the Linux
upstreaming process &ndash; this might change in the future, but - for now - we
plan to mandate that Linux-capable machines subsume the A extension as
part of the RISC-V platform specification.</p>
<p>The <code>-mabi</code> Argument
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;</p>
<p>The <code>-mabi</code> argument to GCC specifies both the integer and
floating-point ABIs to which the generated code complies. Much like how
the <code>-march</code> argument specifies which hardware generated code can run
on, the <code>-mabi</code> argument specifies which software generated code can
link against. We use the standard naming scheme for integer ABIs
(<code>ilp32</code> or <code>lp64</code>), with an argumental single letter appended to select
the floating-point registers used by the ABI (<code>ilp32</code> vs <code>ilp32f</code> vs
<code>ilp32d</code>). In order for objects to be linked together, they must follow
the same ABI.</p>
<p>RISC-V defines two integer ABIs and three floating-point ABIs, which
together are treated as a single ABI string. The integer ABIs follow the
standard ABI naming scheme:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ilp32</code>: <code>int</code>, <code>long</code>, and pointers are all 32-bits long.
<code>long   long</code> is a 64-bit type, <code>char</code> is 8-bit, and <code>short</code>
is 16-bit.</li>
<li><code>lp64</code>: <code>long</code> and pointers are 64-bits long, while <code>int</code> is a
32-bit type. The other types remain the same as ilp32.</li>
</ul>
<p>while the floating-point ABIs are a RISC-V specific addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;&quot; (the empty string): No floating-point arguments are passed
in registers.</li>
<li><code>f</code>: 32-bit and smaller floating-point arguments are passed
in registers. This ABI requires the F extension, as without F there
are no floating-point registers.</li>
<li><code>d</code>: 64-bit and smaller floating-point arguments are passed
in registers. This ABI requires the D extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just like ISA strings, ABI strings are concatenated together and passed
via the <code>-mabi</code> argument to GCC.  In order to explain why the ISA and
ABI should be treated as two separate arguments, let&#x27;s examine a handful
of <code>-march</code>&#x2F;<code>-mabi</code> combinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32d</code>: Hardware floating-point
instructions can be generated and floating-point arguments are
passed in registers. This is like the <code>-mfloat-abi=hard</code> argument to
ARM&#x27;s GCC.</li>
<li><code>-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32</code>: No floating-point instructions can be
generated and no floating-point arguments are passed in registers.
This is like the <code>-mfloat-abi=soft</code> argument to ARM&#x27;s GCC.</li>
<li><code>-march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32</code>: Hardware floating-point
instructions can be generated, but no floating-point arguments will
be passed in registers. This is like the <code>-mfloat-abi=softfp</code>
argument to ARM&#x27;s GCC, and is usually used when interfacing with
soft-float binaries on a hard-float system.</li>
<li><code>-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32d</code>: Illegal, as the ABI requires
floating-point arguments are passed in registers but the ISA defines
no floating-point registers to pass them in.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a more concrete example, let&#x27;s examine a simple C function that takes
two double-precision arguments and returns their product. In order to
make argument location explicit in all cases, we&#x27;ll reverse the order of
the arguments between the function call and the multiplication:</p>
<pre><code>double dmul(double a, double b) {
  return b * a;
}</code></pre>
<p>The first argument is the simplest one: if neither the ABI or ISA
contains the concept of floating-point hardware then the C compiler
cannot emit any floating-point-specific instructions. In this case,
emulation routines are used to perform the computation and the arguments
are passed in integer registers. As you can see, the double-precision
arguments are passed in 32-bit integer register pairs, the order of
arguments is swapped, <code>ra</code> is saved (as it&#x27;s callee saved), the
emulation routine is called, the stack is unwound, and the result is
returned (which is already in <code>a0,a1</code> from <code>__muldf3</code>).</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32 -o- -S -O3
dmul:
  mv      a4,a2
  mv      a5,a3
  add     sp,sp,-16
  mv      a2,a0
  mv      a3,a1
  mv      a0,a4
  mv      a1,a5
  sw      ra,12(sp)
  call    __muldf3
  lw      ra,12(sp)
  add     sp,sp,16
  jr      ra</code></pre>
<p>The second case is the exact opposite of this one: everything is
supported in hardware. In this case we can emit a single <code>fmul.d</code>
instruction to perform the computation, which when register allocated
correctly handles reversing the input arguments and producing the return
value.</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32d -o- -S -O3
dmul:
  fmul.d  fa0,fa1,fa0
  ret</code></pre>
<p>The last case exposes why there is a split between the <code>-march</code> and
<code>-mabi</code> arguments to RISC-V compilers: users may want to generate code
that can be linked with code designed for systems that don&#x27;t subsume a
particular extension while still taking advantage of the extra
instructions present in a particular extension. This is a common problem
when dealing with legacy libraries that need to be integrated into newer
systems so we&#x27;ve designed our compiler arguments and multilib paths to
cleanly integrate with this workflow.</p>
<p>The generated code is essentially a mix between the two above outputs:
the arguments are passed in the registers specified by the <code>ilp32</code> ABI
(as opposed to the <code>ilp32d</code> ABI, which could pass these arguments in
registers) but then once inside the function the compiler is free to use
the full power of the <code>rv32imafdc</code> ISA to actually compute the result.
As a result, the compiler generates the double-precision arguments in
memory (the only way to construct a double on <code>rv32</code>), loads them into
<code>F</code> registers, performs the computation, stores the <code>F</code>-register result
back out to the stack, and loads the result into the ABI-compliant
return value registers (<code>a0</code> and <code>a1</code>). While this is less efficient
than the code the compiler could generate if it was allowed to take full
advantage of the D-extension registers, it&#x27;s a lot more efficient than
computing the floating-point multiplication without the D-extension
instructions</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv32imafdc -mabi=ilp32 -o- -S -O3
dmul:
  add     sp,sp,-16
  sw      a0,8(sp)
  sw      a1,12(sp)
  fld     fa5,8(sp)
  sw      a2,8(sp)
  sw      a3,12(sp)
  fld     fa4,8(sp)
  fmul.d  fa5,fa5,fa4
  fsd     fa5,8(sp)
  lw      a0,8(sp)
  lw      a1,12(sp)
  add     sp,sp,16
  jr      ra</code></pre>
<p>The final possibly ABI&#x2F;ISA combination is easy: it&#x27;s illegal. There&#x27;s no
way the compiler could generate code for an ISA that requires passing
arguments in <code>F</code> registers if it doesn&#x27;t have access to the instructions
required to access those registers. As this must be user error, we bail
out right away.</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc test.c -march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32d -o- -S -O3
cc1: error: requested ABI requires -march to subsume the &#x27;D&#x27; extension</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-mtune</code> Argument
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The last compiler argument that&#x27;s involved in specifying a target is the
simplest of the bunch. While the <code>-march</code> argument can cause systems to
be unable to execute code and the <code>-mabi</code> argument can cause objects to
be incompatible with each other, the <code>-mtune</code> argument should only
change the performance of the generated code. As it currently stands we
really don&#x27;t have any tuning models for RISC-V systems. Unless you&#x27;ve
just added a new tuning parameter to our GCC port, you probably
shouldn&#x27;t bother doing anything with this argument.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170821-relocations.html">August 21, 2017: Relocations in ELF Toolchains </a> </h2>
    <p>Our first stop on our exploration of the RISC-V toolchain will be an
overview of ELF relocations and how they are used by the RISC-V
toolchain. We&#x27;ll shy away from discussing linker relaxations and their
impact on performance for a follow-up blog post so this doesn&#x27;t get too
long. The example has been carefully constructed to be unrelaxable as
to avoid confusion. Additionally we&#x27;re only going to discuss the
relocations used by statically linked executables, avoid discussing
position independent executables and forget about thread local storage
&ndash; like linker relaxation, all of those warrant a whole post on their
own. There will be a lot more to come about relocations in later blog
posts.</p>
<h4 id="an-example-of-a-relocation-in-a-c-program">An Example of a Relocation in a C Program</h2>
<p>Relocations are a concept that exists due to the split between the compiler and
the linker that is present in most toolchains. While the specifics of this
article will apply only to ELF-based RISC-V toolchains (i.e., GCC+binutils or
LLVM), the general concept of relocations exists in farther-reaching compilers
like Hotspot. Since relocations exist to pass information between the compiler
and linker, let&#x27;s first look at how a simple program is compiled. Take the
following C code:</p>
<p>    long global<em>symbol[2];
<br />
    int main() {
      return global</em>symbol[0] != 0;
    }</p>
<p>Even though a single GCC invocation can produce a binary for this simple case,
under the covers the GCC driver script is actually running the preprocessor,
then the compiler, then the assembler and finally the linker. The
<code>--save-temps</code> argument to GCC allows users to see all these intermediate
files, and is a useful argument for poking around inside the toolchain.</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc relocation.c -o relocation -O3 --save-temps</code></pre>
<p>Each step in this run of the GCC wrapper script generates a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>relocation.i</code>: The preprocessed source, which expands any preprocessor
directives (things like <code>#include</code> or <code>#ifdef</code>).</li>
<li><code>relocation.s</code>: The output of the actual compiler, which is an assembly file (a
text file in the RISC-V assembly format).</li>
<li><code>relocation.o</code>: The output of the assembler, which is an un-linked object file
(an ELF file, but not an executable ELF).</li>
<li><code>relocation</code>: The output of the linker, which is a linked executable (an
executable ELF file).</li>
</ul>
<p>The first step is to run the preprocessor. Since this is a simple source file with
no preprocessor macros, the preprocessor run is pretty boring: all it does is
emit some directives to be used if debugging information is later generated:</p>
<p>    $ cat relocation.i
    # 1 &quot;relocation.c&quot;
    # 1 &quot;built-in&quot;
    # 1 &quot;command-line&quot;
    # 31 &quot;command-line&quot;
    # 1 &quot;&#x2F;scratch&#x2F;palmer&#x2F;work&#x2F;upstream&#x2F;riscv-gnu-toolchain&#x2F;build&#x2F;install&#x2F;sysroot&#x2F;usr&#x2F;include&#x2F;stdc-predef.h&quot; 1 3 4
    # 32 &quot;command-line&quot; 2
    # 1 &quot;relocation.c&quot;
    long global<em>symbol;
<br />
    int main() {
      return global</em>symbol != 0;
    }</p>
<p>The preprocessed output is then fed through the compiler, which generates a
assembly file. It is at this point at which we begin to see why relocations
are necessary. This file is plain-text that contains RISC-V assembly code and
therefor is easy to read, so let&#x27;s take a look right now:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat relocation.s
main:
  lui   a5,%hi(global_symbol)
  ld    a0,%lo(global_symbol)(a5)
  snez  a0,a0
  ret</code></pre>
<p>If you&#x27;re not accustomed to reading the assembly output from RISC-V&#x27;s GCC port
then this might look a bit odd: there&#x27;s an additional pair of
addressing modes that aren&#x27;t listed anywhere in the RISC-V instruction manual
and don&#x27;t really look like they could be sensibly implemented in hardware:
<code>%hi(global_symbol)</code> and <code>%lo(global_symbol)(a5)</code>.</p>
<p>These addressing modes exist to allow the compiler to address global symbols.
The fundamental problem with addressing global symbols is that the compiler
must emit assembly instructions in order to access said symbols but the actual
address of those global symbols cannot be known until link time, an impossible
task.  As a concrete example try to figure out what bits the compiler would
emit for the <code>lui</code> that addresses <code>global_symbol</code>.</p>
<p>Relocations resolve this discrepancy: when the compiler is unable to know the
bits that should be emitted as part of a particular instruction, in instead
just emits arbitrary bits for that instruction and also emits a relocation
entry. This relocation entry points to the bits that will be emitted and
contains enough information for the linker to fill out those bits.</p>
<p>The specifics of this are probably best explained by example, so let&#x27;s go
through the simple program above to see how it all works. The next link in the
toolchain is the assembler, which takes in the assembly file from above and
produces an ELF object file that has not yet been linked. You can examine
these object files with objdump, which I&#x27;ve done below:</p>
<p>    $ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-objdump -d -t -r relocation.o
<br />
    relocation.o:     file format elf64-littleriscv

<p>Now is the first point at which you get to explicitly see a relocation (which
are only shown when the <code>-r</code> argument is passed to objdump).  Here we can see
four RISC-V-specific relocations in two pairs: a
<code>R_RISCV_HI20</code>+<code>R_RISCV_RELAX</code> pair for the <code>lui</code> and a
<code>R-RISCV_LO12_I</code>+<code>R_RISCV_RELAX</code> pair for the <code>ld</code>.  The
<code>R_RISCV_RELAX</code> relocations exist solely to signify that it is legal to
perform linker relaxation on the previous relocation. Since we&#x27;re not talking
about linker relaxation in this blog entry, we can just ignore those entries for
now.</p>
<p>The other two relocations pair explicitly with an addressing mode present in
the RISC-V ISA: <code>R_RISCV_HI20</code> pairs with a U-format immediate while
<code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code> pairs with an I-format immediate. In general, you&#x27;ll find
that every addressing mode with an immediate will have at least one relocation
that fills out that immediate &ndash; sometimes there&#x27;ll be a handful more if
that instruction format is used to link against more complicated forms of
symbols as well (for example, PIC or TLS relocations).</p>
<p>Before we get too deep into relocations, let&#x27;s quickly examine how the
toolchain works when it&#x27;s possible to fill out a relocation correctly. The
next link in the toolchain is the linker, which consumes the relocations
generated by the assembler to fill our the relevant bits in the output ELF
executable. The program now has all the glibc startup code so it&#x27;s become
quite large. Thus, I&#x27;m only posting the relevant snippets below:</p>

<p>As you can see, the symbol table now has an actual address for
<code>global_symbol</code>, the instructions that were referenced by the relocations
have some non-zero bits filled out to reference <code>global_symbol</code>, and the
relocations have been dropped from the ELF file as they&#x27;re no longer necessary
&ndash; this is only strictly the case because we have a statically-linked symbol,
relocating dynamic symbols is deferred to the loader in that case.</p>
<h4 id="the---relocation-truncated-to-fit---error-message">The <code>relocation truncated to fit</code> Error Message</h2>
<p>Now that you know a bit about what relocations are we can discuss most people&#x27;s
only exposure to relocations: the <code>relocation truncated to fit</code> error
message that appears when linking. It&#x27;s hard to explain this message to people
who don&#x27;t understand relocations, but if you understand what a relocation is
then it&#x27;s not actually that tricky of an error message.</p>
<p>In order to explain the error message, we&#x27;ll start with an extremely simple
program. In this case we don&#x27;t want anything from the C library to show up in
our error message so we&#x27;re defining <code>_start</code> instead of <code>main</code> and then
avoiding any standard library objects by passing <code>-nostdlib -nostartfiles</code> to
GCC &ndash; this program won&#x27;t actually work, but it&#x27;ll serve to explain what&#x27;s
going on. Moving the text section with <code>-Wl,-Ttext-segment,0x80000000</code> will
actually trigger the bug, you&#x27;ll see why below:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat reloc_fail.c
long global_symbol;
int _start() {
  return global_symbol;
}
$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc reloc_fail.c -o reloc_fail -O3 -nostartfiles -nostdlib --save-temps  -Wl,-Ttext-segment,0x80000000
reloc_fail.o: In function `_start&#x27;:
reloc_fail.c:(.text+0x0): relocation truncated to fit: R_RISCV_HI20 against symbol `global_symbol&#x27; defined in COMMON section in reloc_fail.o

collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</code></pre>
<p>On the surface this looks like a super scary error message: there&#x27;s all sorts
of references to temporary objects; the mention of symbols, sections and
relocations; and an odd message about debug sections. This is usually the
point at which people give up and call a toolchain hacker, but with your
newfound knowledge of relocations you should be able to figure out what&#x27;s going
on here.</p>
<p>First, let&#x27;s focus on only the important part of the error message and ignore
all the cruft that&#x27;s not actually relevant. The actual error you want to look
at here is:</p>
<pre><code>reloc_fail.c:(.text+0x0): relocation truncated to fit: R_RISCV_HI20 against symbol `global_symbol&#x27;</code></pre>
<p>which simply states that the compiler generated a <code>R_RISCV_HI20</code> relocation
against the address <code>global_symbol</code>, but that the linker was unable fit the
symbol&#x27;s full address into the bits specified by that relocation. The phrase
&quot;truncated to fit&quot; is a bit odd: what the linker is actually saying is that the
address in the relocation must be truncated to fit into the bits allocated by
the relocation if it was to fit, but since this is an error the linker isn&#x27;t
really truncating anything.</p>
<p>In order to start really delving into the &quot;why&quot; of the error message, we need to first
look at the input to the linker, which in this case is the object file
generated by the assembler. Like the above example, we need the relocation
because the compiler needs to reference a global symbol that it can&#x27;t know the
address for.</p>

<p>As we can clearly see, the instructions that load the value of
<code>global_symbol</code> do not actually match the address of <code>global_symbol</code> as
listed by the symbol table, which is exactly what the <code>relocation truncated to
fit</code> error message is trying to say. In the particular case of the
<code>R_RISCV_HI20</code>+<code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code> relocation pair the largest absolute
address that can be generated is <code>0x7FFFFFFF</code> &ndash; remember U-type immediates
are signed on RISC-V, so any larger absolute address overflows on RV64.</p>
<p>While every architecture performs some relocations when linking, RISC-V
leverages the linker&#x27;s relocation infrastructure more aggressively than any other
architecture so these sorts of issues may crop up more frequently than in other
ports.  We&#x27;ll be talking a lot about relocations in the blog as they frequently
drive other toolchain design issues.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170828-linker_relaxation.html">August 28, 2017: Linker Relaxation in the RISC-V Toolchain </a> </h2>
    <p><a href="20170821-relocations.html">Last week&#x27;s blog entry</a> discussed
relocations and how they apply to the RISC-V toolchain. This week we&#x27;ll
be delving a bit deeper into the RISC-V linker to discuss linker
relaxation, a concept so important it has greatly shaped the design of
the RISC-V ISA. Linker relaxation is a mechanism for optimizing
programs at link-time, as opposed to traditional program optimization
which happens at compile-time. This blog will follow an example linker
relaxation through the toolchain, demonstrate an example of how linker
relaxations meaningfully improve the performance of a real program and
introduce a new RISC-V relocation. We&#x27;ll shy away from discussing the
impact of linker relaxations on the RISC-V ISA, until another blog
entry.</p>
<p>Just like last time, we&#x27;ll start with a simple C test program that&#x27;s not
linked against anything else. This program won&#x27;t perform a sane
computation, the goal is just that it&#x27;s simple enough to get the point
across. I&#x27;ll skip the assembly this time: as this post is about the
linker, we can&#x27;t really discuss anything until we get to an object file. 
Since you&#x27;re now an expert in the toolchain, I&#x27;ll just blast out some
commands here:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat test.c
int func(int a) __attribute__((noinline));
int func(int a) {
  return a + 1;
}

int _start(int a) {
  return func(a);
}

   8:   00030067                jr      ra</code></pre>
<p>You can now see a new RISC-V relocation: <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code>.  This
relocation sits between an <code>auipc</code> and a <code>jalr</code> instruction (here
disassembled as the <code>jr</code> shorthand as this is a tail call) and points to
the symbol that should be the target of the jump, in this case the
<code>func</code> symbol. The <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> relocation is paired with a
<code>R_RISCV_RELAX</code> relocation, which allows the linker to relax this
relocation pair &ndash; the whole point of this blog!</p>
<p>In order to understand relaxation, we first must examine the RISC-V ISA a
bit. In the RISC-V ISA there are two unconditional control transfer
instructions: <code>jalr</code>, which jumps to an absolute address as specified by
an immediate offset from a register; and <code>jal</code>, which jumps to a
pc-relative offset as specified by an immediate. The only differences
between the <code>auipc</code>+<code>jalr</code> pair in this object file and a single <code>jal</code>
are that the pair can address a 32-bit signed offset from the current PC
while the <code>jal</code> can only address a 21-bit signed offset from the current
PC, and that the <code>jal</code> instruction is half the size (which is a good
proxy for twice the speed).</p>
<p>As the compiler cannot know if the offset between <code>_start</code> and <code>func</code>
will fit within a 21-bit offset, it is forced to generate the longer
call. We don&#x27;t want to impose this cost in cases where it&#x27;s not
necessary, so we instead optimize this case in the linker. Let&#x27;s look
at the executable to see the result of linker relaxation:</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-objdump -d -r test

<p>As you can see, the linker knows that the call from <code>_start</code> to <code>func</code>
fits within the 21-bit offset of the <code>jal</code> instruction and converts it
to a single instruction.</p>
<h4 id="the-risc-v-implementation-of-linker-relaxation">The RISC-V Implementation of Linker Relaxation</h2>
<p>While the concept of linker relaxation is fairly straight-forward, there
are a lot of tricky details that need to be done correctly in order to
ensure the linker produces the correct symbol addresses everywhere. To
the best of my knowledge, the RISC-V BFD port make the most aggressive
use of linker relaxations: essentially no <code>.text</code> section symbol
addresses are known until link time.  This has a few interesting side
effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.align</code> directives must be handled by the linker for any relaxable
sections.</li>
<li>Debug information must be emitted twice: once by the compiler for the
object file and once again by the linker for the executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these points probably warrant blog posts of their own &ndash; some of
these are planned, others require me to fix some bugs before I feel
comfortable talking about them :).</p>
<p>The actual implementation of linker relaxation is, as you&#x27;d expect,
fairly esoteric. The code lives in <code>_bfd_riscv_relax_section</code> inside
<code>binutils-gdb&#x2F;bfd&#x2F;elfnn-riscv.c</code>, which looks roughly like the
following:</p>
<pre><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_section:
  if section shouldn&#x27;t be relaxed:
    return DONE
  for each relocation:
    if relocation is relaxable:
      store per-relocation function pointer
    read the symbol table
    obtain the symbol&#x27;s address
    call the per-relocation function</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, all it&#x27;s doing is some shared bookkeeping code and then
calling a relocation-specific function to actually relax the relocation.
The relax functions all look somewhat similar, so I&#x27;ll show an example
of the function that relaxes <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> relocation that was
discussed above</p>
<pre><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_call:
  compute a pessimistic address range
  if relocation doesn&#x27;t fit into a UJ-type immediate:
    return DONE
  compute offsets for various short jumps
  if RVC is enabled and the relocation fits in a C.JAL:
    convert the jump to c.jal
  if relocation fits in an JAL:
    convert the jump to a jal
  if call target is near absolute address 0:
    convert the jump to a x0-offset JALR
  delete the JALR, as it&#x27;s not necessary any more</code></pre>
<p>While this specific function only relaxes the <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> relocation,
it follows the pattern that most of the implementations of the
relaxation functions do:</p>
<pre><code>generic_relax_function:
  add some slack to the address, as all addresses can move
  for each possible instruction to shorten the relocation:
    if possible instruction can fit the target address:
      replace the relocation
      cleanup
      return DONE
  return DONE</code></pre>
<p>There&#x27;s one of these functions for each class of relocations that the
RISC-V toolchain knows how to relax:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_call</code>: relaxes two-instruction <code>auipc</code>+<code>jalr</code>
sequences via the <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> and <code>R_RISCV_CALL_PLT</code> relocations.</li>
<li><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_lui</code>: relaxes two-instruction <code>lui</code>+<code>addi</code>-like
sequences via the <code>R_RISCV_HI20</code>+<code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code>-like relocation
pairs.  The second instruction&#x2F;relocation can be any of the various
instructions that matches a <code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code> or <code>R_RISCV_LO12_S</code>
relocation (<code>addi</code>, <code>lw</code>, <code>sd</code>, etc).</li>
<li><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_pc</code>: Relaxes two-instruction <code>auipc</code>+<code>addi</code>-like
sequences via the <code>R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20&#x27;+&#x27;R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I</code>-like
relocation pairs.  Much like the <code>lui</code> case there&#x27;s a handful of
relocation types possible for the second one, all of which are
PC-relative.</li>
<li><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_tls_le</code>: Relaxes thread local storage references
when using the local executable model.  We&#x27;ll talk about TLS is a
later blog, as there&#x27;s a lot going on here.</li>
<li><code>_bfd_riscv_relax_align</code>: Relaxes <code>.align</code> directives in text
sections.  This is another on we&#x27;ll discuss later, but one specific
interesting constraint here is that <code>R_RISCV_ALIGN</code> relocations must
be relaxed for correctness, which means they&#x27;re relaxed even when
relaxations are otherwise disabled.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="relaxing-against-the-global-pointer">Relaxing Against the Global Pointer</h2>
<p>It may seem like linker relaxation involves a huge amount of
complexity for a small gain: we trade knowing no <code>.text</code> section symbol
addresses until link time for shortening a few sequences by a single
instruction. As it turns out, linker relaxation is very important for
getting good performance on real code. For our first time looking at
real code, we&#x27;ll take a look at the Dhrystone benchmark &ndash; in addition
to being super simple, Dhrystone also spends a lot of time loading from
global variables and therefor benefits very clearly from linker
relaxation.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take a look at the Dhrystone source code first. While it&#x27;s a bit
more complicated than the examples that have been present in this blog
so far, if you look closely the code is actually pretty
straightforward. Here&#x27;s the source for one Dhrystone function, along
with the definitions of the various global variables it references:</p>
<pre><code>&#x2F;* Global Variables: *&#x2F;
Boolean         Bool_Glob;
char            Ch_1_Glob,
                Ch_2_Glob;

Proc_4 () &#x2F;* without parameters *&#x2F;
&#x2F;*******&#x2F;
    &#x2F;* executed once *&#x2F;
{
  Boolean Bool_Loc;

  Bool_Loc = Ch_1_Glob == &#x27;A&#x27;;
  Bool_Glob = Bool_Loc | Bool_Glob;
  Ch_2_Glob = &#x27;B&#x27;;
} &#x2F;* Proc_4 *&#x2F;</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the code performs three accesses to global variables in
order to do a simple comparison and a logical operation. While this
might seem kind of silly, this is what a lot of the Dhrystone benchmark
looks like. Since Dhrystone is pretty much the only benchmark that will
actually run <em>everywhere</em> (SPECInt won&#x27;t run on my wristwatch, for
example), it&#x27;s still used as the baseline for many microarchitectural
comparisons so we need to make it go fast.</p>
<p>In order to understand the specific relaxation that&#x27;s being performed in
this case, it&#x27;s probably best to start with the code the toolchain
generates before this optimization, which I&#x27;ve copied below:</p>
<pre><code>0000000040400826 &lt;Proc_4&gt;:

<p>As you can see, this function consists of 13 instructions, 4 of which
are <code>auipc</code> instructions. All of these <code>auipc</code> instructions are used to
calculate the addresses of global variables for a subsequent memory
access, and all of these generated addresses are within a 12-bit offset
of each other. If you&#x27;re thinking &quot;we only really need one of these
<code>auipc</code> instructions&quot;, you&#x27;re both right and wrong: while we could
generate a single <code>auipc</code> (though that requires some GCC work we haven&#x27;t
done yet and is thus the subject of a future blog post), we can actually
do one better and get by with <em>zero</em> <code>auipc</code> instructions!</p>
<p>If you&#x27;ve just gone and pored over the RISC-V ISA manual to find an
instruction that loads <code>Ch_1_Glob</code> (which lives at <code>0x8000079D</code>) in a
single instruction then you should give up now, as there isn&#x27;t one.
There is, of course, a trick &ndash; it is common on register-rich,
addressing-mode-poor ISAs to have a dedicated ABI register known as the
global pointer that contains an address in the <code>.data</code> segment. The
linker is then capable of relaxing accesses to global variables that
live within a 12-bit signed offset from this value &ndash; essentially we&#x27;ve
just cached the <code>lui</code> in the global pointer register, optimizing this
common code path.</p>
<p>In order to get a bit more visibility into how this works, let&#x27;s take a
look at a snippet of GCC&#x27;s default linker script for RISC-V:</p>
<pre><code>&#x2F;* We want the small data sections together, so single-instruction offsets
   can access them all, and initialized data all before uninitialized, so
   we can shorten the on-disk segment size.  *&#x2F;
.sdata          :
{
  __global_pointer$ = . + 0x800;
  *(.srodata.cst16) *(.srodata.cst8) *(.srodata.cst4) *(.srodata.cst2) *(.srodata .srodata.*)
  *(.sdata .sdata.* .gnu.linkonce.s.*)
}
_edata = .; PROVIDE (edata = .);
. = .;
__bss_start = .;
.sbss           :
{
  *(.dynsbss)
  *(.sbss .sbss.* .gnu.linkonce.sb.*)
  *(.scommon)</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the magic <code>__global_pointer$</code> symbol is defined to point
<code>0x800</code> bytes past the start of the <code>.sdata</code> section. The <code>0x800</code> magic
number allows signed 12-bit offsets from <code>__global_pointer$</code> to address
symbols at the start of the <code>.sdata</code> section. The linker assumes that
if this symbol is defined, then the <code>gp</code> register contains that value,
which it can then use to relax accesses to global symbols within that
12-bit range. The compiler treats the <code>gp</code> register as a constant so it
doesn&#x27;t need to be saved or restored, which means it is generally only
written by <code>_start</code>, the ELF entry point. Here&#x27;s an example from the
RISC-V newlib port&#x27;s <code>crt0.S</code> file</p>
<pre><code>.option push
.option norelax
1:auipc gp, %pcrel_hi(__global_pointer$)
  addi  gp, gp, %pcrel_lo(1b)
.option pop</code></pre>
<p>Note that we need to disable relaxations while setting <code>gp</code>, otherwise
the linker would relax this two-instruction sequence to <code>mv gp, gp</code></p>
<p>The actual implementation of the relaxation, which lives in
<code>_bfd_riscv_relax_lui&#x27; and </code><em>bfd</em>riscv<em>relax</em>pc`, is fairly boring.
Like all the other relaxations, it performs some bounds checks, deletes
the unused instruction and then converts the short-offset instruction
to a different type. We may delve deeper into the implementation of
various linker relaxations in future blog posts, but for now I&#x27;ll just
drop the relaxed output here to demonstrate it actually works:</p>

<p>Just to be clear: linker relaxations are an optimization for the common
case. The linker transparently emits two-instruction addressing
sequences for symbols that it cannot optimize. To demonstrate what
happens when the linker can&#x27;t relax a symbol, let&#x27;s go through another
example:</p>
<p>    $ cat relax.c
    long near;
    long far[2];
<br />
    long data(void) {
      return near | far;
    }
<br />
    int main() {
      return data();
    }

<p>Here we can see three relocations groups: two <code>HI20</code>&#x2F;<code>LO12</code> relocation
pairs and a <code>CALL</code> relocation. In this case, the <code>CALL</code> relocation can
be relaxed as can the <code>HI20</code>&#x2F;<code>LO12</code> pair that references <code>near</code>, but the
<code>HI20</code>&#x2F;<code>LO12</code> pair that references <code>far</code> can&#x27;t. In this case the
linker still functions correctly, producing a single-instruction
addressing sequence for the <code>near</code> symbol it can relax while just
relocating the addressing sequence for the <code>far</code> symbol that it can&#x27;t
reference with a single instruction.</p>

be a bit more explicit:</p>

<p>In the example above, we can see the <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> relocation is requested.
This relocation is defined to operate over an adjacent <code>auipc</code>&#x2F;<code>jalr</code> pair,
referencing a signed 32-bit PC-relative call target. In this case we were able
to relax this instruction pair to a single <code>jal</code> instruction as the actual
call target was within a 21-bit signed offset from the current PC. You&#x27;ll find
that almost all <code>R_RISCV_CALL</code> relocations will be relaxable, as most code
expresses some amount of call locality.</p>

a <code>lui</code> while the <code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code> relocates the 12-bit offset of various
I-type instructions (<code>ld</code> in this example). In this case we were able to
relax this instruction pair to a single <code>ld</code> instruction, as the final symbol
address was within a 12-bit offset of <code>gp</code>, the global pointer.</p>

<p>In the example above, we see another <code>R_RISCV_HI20</code>&#x2F;<code>R_RISCV_LO12_I</code>, but
this time we can&#x27;t relax it as it&#x27;s not within a 12-bit offset of <code>gp</code>. Note
that we still generate the correct code for this case by filling out the
relocations. You will get a link-time error whenever it is impossible to
correctly relocate a requested relocation, as otherwise the linked executable
wouldn&#x27;t produce the correct answer.</p>
<p>Stay tuned, as there&#x27;s a whole lot more to come on linker relaxations in
future blog posts.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170911-cmodel.html">September 11, 2017: The RISC-V Code Models </a> </h2>
    <p>The RISC-V ISA was designed to be both simple and modular. In order to
achieve these design goals, RISC-V minimizes one of the largest costs in
implementing complex ISAs: addressing modes. Addressing modes are
expensive both in small designs (due to decode cost) and large designs
(due to implicit dependencies). RISC-V only has three addressing modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>PC-relative, via the <code>auipc</code>, <code>jal</code> and <code>br*</code> instructions.</li>
<li>Register-offset, via the <code>jalr</code>, <code>addi</code> and all memory instructions.</li>
<li>Absolute, via the <code>lui</code> instruction (though arguably this is just
<code>x0</code>-offset).</li>
</ul>
<p>These addressing modes have been carefully selected in order to allow
for efficient code generation with a minimum of hardware complexity. We
achieve this simplicity by relying on modern toolchains to optimize
addressing in software &ndash; this stands in stark contrast to traditional
ISAs, which implement a plethora of addressing modes in hardware
instead. Studies have shown that the RISC-V approach is sound: we are
able to achieve similar code size in benchmarks while having vastly
simpler decoding rules and a significant amount of free encoding space.</p>
<p>All these hardware complexity reductions come at the cost of increased
software complexity. This blog post introduces another bit of software
complexity in RISC-V: the concept of a code model. Just like
relocations and relaxations, code models are not specific to RISC-V &ndash;
in fact, the RISC-V toolchain has fewer code models than most popular
ISAs, largely because we rely on software optimizations instead of
wacky addressing modes, which allows our addressing modes to be
significantly more flexible.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-code-model">What is a Code Model</h2>
<p>Most programs do not fill the entire address space available to them with
symbols (most don&#x27;t fill it at all, but those that do tend to fill their
address space with heap). ISAs tend to take advantage of this locality by
implementing shorter addressing modes in hardware and relying on software to
provide larger address modes. The code model determines which software
addressing mode is used, and, therefore, what constraints are enforced on the
linked program. Software addressing modes determine how the programmer
sees addresses, as opposed to hardware addressing modes which determine
how address bits in instructions are handled. </p>
<p>Code models are necessary due to the split between the compiler and the linker:
when generating an unlinked object, the complier doesn&#x27;t know the
absolute address of any symbol but it still must know what addressing
mode to use as some addressing modes may require scratch registers to
operate. As the compiler cannot generate actual addressing code, it
generates addressing templates (known as
<a href="20170821-relocations.md">relocations</a>) that the linker can then fix up
once it knows the actual addresses of each symbol. The code model
determines what these addressing templates look like, and thus which
relocations are emitted.</p>
<p>This is probably best explained with an example. Imagine the following
C code:</p>
<p>    long global<em>symbol[2];
<br />
    int main() {
      return global</em>symbol[0] != 0;
    }</p>
<p>Even though a single GCC invocation can produce a binary for this simple case,
under the covers the GCC driver script is actually running the preprocessor,
then the compiler, then the assembler and finally the linker. The
<code>--save-temps</code> argument to GCC allows users to see all these intermediate
files, and is a useful argument for poking around inside the toolchain.</p>
<pre><code>$ riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc cmodel.c -o cmodel -O3 --save-temps</code></pre>
<p>Each step in this run of the GCC wrapper script generates a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cmodel.i</code>: The preprocessed source, which expands any preprocessor
directives (things like <code>#include</code> or <code>#ifdef</code>).</li>
<li><code>cmodel.s</code>: The output of the actual compiler, which is an assembly file (a
text file in the RISC-V assembly format).</li>
<li><code>cmodel.o</code>: The output of the assembler, which is an unlinked object file
(an ELF file, but not an executable ELF).</li>
<li><code>cmodel</code>: The output of the linker, which is a linked executable (an
executable ELF file).</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to understand why the code model exists, we must first examine this
toolchain flow in a bit more detail. Since this is a simple source file with
no preprocessor macros, the preprocessor run is pretty boring: all it does is
emit some directives to be used if debugging information is later generated:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat cmodel.i
# 1 &quot;cmodel.c&quot;
# 1 &quot;built-in&quot;
# 1 &quot;command-line&quot;
# 31 &quot;command-line&quot;
# 1 &quot;&#x2F;scratch&#x2F;palmer&#x2F;work&#x2F;upstream&#x2F;riscv-gnu-toolchain&#x2F;build&#x2F;install&#x2F;sysroot&#x2F;usr&#x2F;include&#x2F;stdc-predef.h&quot; 1 3 4
# 32 &quot;command-line&quot; 2
# 1 &quot;cmodel.c&quot;
long global_symbol;

int main() {
  return global_symbol != 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>The preprocessed output is then fed through the compiler, which generates a
assembly file. This file is plain text that contains RISC-V assembly code and
therefore is easy to read:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat cmodel.s
main:
  lui   a5,%hi(global_symbol)
  ld    a0,%lo(global_symbol)(a5)
  snez  a0,a0
  ret</code></pre>
<p>The generated assembly contains a pair of instructions to address
<code>global_symbol</code>: <code>lui</code> and then <code>ld</code>. This imposes a constraint on the
address that <code>global_symbol</code> can take on: it must be addressable by a 32-bit
signed absolute constant (not 32-bit offset from some register or the PC, but
actually a 32-bit address). Note that the restriction on symbol addresses is
not related to the size of a pointer on this architecture: specifically pointers
may still be 64 bits here, but all global symbols must be addressable by a
32-bit absolute address.</p>
<p>After the compiler generates assembly, the GCC wrapper script calls the
assembler to generate an object file. This file is an ELF binary, which can be
read with a variety of tools provided by Binutils. In case we&#x27;ll use
<code>objdump</code> to show the symbol table, disassemble the text section and show
the relocations generated by the assembler:</p>

<p>At this point we have an object file, but we still don&#x27;t know the actual
addresses of any global symbols. This is where there&#x27;s a bit of overlap in the
roles of each component of the toolchain: it&#x27;s the assembler&#x27;s job to convert
textual instructions into bits, but in the cases where those bits depend on the
address of a global symbol (like the <code>lui</code> in the code above, for example)
the assembler can&#x27;t know what those bits should actually be. In order to allow
the linker to fill out these bits in the final executable object file, the
assembler generates entries in a relocation table for every bit range the
linker is expected to fill out. Relocations define a bit range that the linker
is meant to fill out when linking the code together. The specific definition
of any relocation type present in the text section is ISA-specific, the RISC-V
definitions can be found in our <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/blob/master/riscv-elf.md">ELF psABI
document</a>.</p>
<p>After assembling the program, the GCC wrapper script runs the linker to
generate an executable. This is another ELF file, but this time it&#x27;s a full
executable. Since this contains lots of C library code, I&#x27;m going to show only
the relevant fragments of it here:</p>

<p>There are a few interesting things to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The symbol table contains symbols with actual, absolute values. This is the
whole point of the linker.</li>
<li>The text section contains the correct bits to actually reference the global
symbols, as opposed to just a bunch of 0s.</li>
<li>The relocations against global symbols have been removed, as they&#x27;re no
longer necessary. Some relocations may still exist in executables to allow
for things like dynamic linking, but in this simple case there are none.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that that <code>-mcmodel=medany</code> currently defaults to
<code>-mno-explicit-relocs</code>, which can have an appreciable performance
effect. There&#x27;s a bit of nuance in that performance effect, so we&#x27;ll
discuss it in a later blog.</p>
<h4 id="the-difference-between-a-code-model-and-an-abi">The Difference Between a Code Model and an ABI</h2>
<p>One commonly misunderstood distinction is the difference between a code
model and an ABI. The ABI determines the interface between functions,
while the code model determines how code is generated within a function.
Specifically: both RISC-V code models limit the code that addresses
symbols to 32-bit offsets, but on RV64I-based systems they still encode
pointers as 64-bit.</p>
<p>Specifically this means that functions compiled with <code>-mcmodel=medany</code>
can be called by functions compiled with <code>-mcmodel=medlow</code>, and vice
versa. The restrictions placed on symbol addressing by both of these
functions will need to be met in order to allow an executable to be
linked, but that constraint is just generally true. As the code model
doesn&#x27;t affect the layout of structures in memory or how arguments are
passed between functions it&#x27;s largely transparent to programs.</p>
<p>Contrast this to linking code generated for two different ABIs, which
is invalid. Imagine a function that contains a <code>double</code> argument. A
function compiled for <code>lp64d</code> will expect this argument in a register.
When called by a function compiled for <code>lp64</code> that places the argument
in an X register the program won&#x27;t work correctly.</p>
<h4 id="code-models-and-linker-relaxation">Code Models and Linker Relaxation</h2>
<p>Up until this point we haven&#x27;t discussed how code models interact with
<a href="20170828-linker_relaxation.html">linker relaxation</a>, largely because
the answer is now fairly simple: it all just works, assuming you use the
RISC-V branches of the various toolchain components as there are a
handful of patches that haven&#x27;t found their way upstream yet.</p>
<p>Linker relaxation is actually an important enough optimization that it
affected the RISC-V ISA in a significant manner: linker relaxation
allows RISC-V to forgo an addressing mode that would otherwise be
required to get reasonable performance on many codebases. On RISC-V
targets, the following addressing modes are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Symbols within a 7-bit offset from 0 (or from <code>__global_pointer$</code>): 2 bytes.</li>
<li>Symbols within a 12-bit offset from 0 (or from <code>__global_pointer$</code>): 4 bytes.</li>
<li>Symbols within a 17-bit offset from 0: 6 bytes.</li>
<li>Symbols within a 32-bit offset from 0: 8 bytes. On RV32I this is the
entire address space.</li>
</ul>
<p>This can all be achieved with a single code model, and while using a
single hardware addressing mode (register+offset) via eight instruction
formats (U, I, S, CI, CR, CIW, CL, and CS) without any mode bits. You
could view this as a sort of variable-length address encoding that&#x27;s
optional to support in hardware &ndash; for more information see the
&quot;Compressed Macro-Op Fusion&quot; paper. As this compressing is all
implemented transparently by the linker, we only need a single code
model. Contrast this behavior with the ARMv8 GCC port, which requires
selecting a different code model for each of the address generation
sequences it can emit.<br /></p>
<p>Achieving variable-length addressing sequences is usually something
reserved for CISC processors, which achieve this by implementing a
plethora of addressing modes in hardware and opportunistically shrinking
addressing sequences at assembly time when possible. The RISC-V method
of using fusible multi-instruction addressing sequences and linker
relaxation has the advantages of both allowing simple implementations
and resulting in similar code size.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20170918-multilib.html">September 18, 2017: Per-`march` and per-`mabi` Library Paths on RISC-V Systems </a> </h2>
    <p>A <a href="20170814-march_mabi_mtune.html">previous blog</a> described how the
<code>-march</code> and <code>-mabi</code> command-line arguments to GCC can be used to
control code generation for the sources you compile as a user, but most
programs require linking against system libraries in order to function
correctly. Since users generally don&#x27;t want to compile every library
along with their program, either because they&#x27;re too complicated or
because they&#x27;re meant to be shared, a mechanism is needed for linking against
the correct set of system libraries to match the ISA of the user&#x27;s
target system and the ABI of the user&#x27;s generated code. </p>
<p>The mechanism for handling multiple sets of system libraries is known as
&quot;multilib&quot;. Like most parts of the RISC-V toolchain, the multilib
mechanism is shared between all architecture ports but the specifics of
how it applies to RISC-V is specific to our ISA. As RISC-V is a
modular ISA, it was natural to have extensive multilib support from the
start. This allows our multilib implementation to be significantly
cleaner than a lot of other architectures, which is good because the
plethora of ISAs and ABIs we have necessitates good multilib support.</p>
<h4 id="the-gcc-compiler-wrapper">The GCC Compiler Wrapper</h2>
<p>As discussed in an earlier blog post, the <code>gcc</code> command that users
directly interact with is a actually just a wrapper that calls each step
in the toolchain in order: preprocess, compile, assemble and link your
program. <code>gcc</code> isn&#x27;t actually a script, but instead a small C program
that orchestrates the compilation. The architecture-specific hooks for
this program consist of a domain-specific language that is specific to
GCC&#x27;s command-line argument handling and describes how the argument to the
<code>gcc</code> wrapper should be transformed as they are passed to the various
other tools that are called.</p>
<p>In order to ensure things are sufficiently complicated, there are three
different languages used to describe how paths are mangled between the
user&#x27;s invocation of <code>gcc</code> and the invocation of <code>cc1</code> or <code>collect2</code>
that actually does the work. All of these are specific to GCC
command-line argument parsing. The <code>gcc</code> command-line wrapper uses
these tools in various combinations to specify the following multilib
related arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assembler needs to know the ELF class to generate, either ELF32 or
ELF64 depending on the target processor&#x27;s architecture.</li>
<li>The linker needs to know the link-time paths that should be searched
for libraries.</li>
<li>The assembler needs to know the ABI, so it can fill out the relevant
ELF flags. This lets the linker to disallow linking objects of different
ABIs, which would be incompatible.</li>
<li>The linker needs to know the path to the dynamic linker so it can fill
out the ELF interpreter field. The dynamic linker has paths built
into it to know where to search for libraries.</li>
<li>The linker needs to know the C runtime files that should be linked
into executables, as well as any additional libraries that should be
linked in by default such as <code>libatomic</code> or <code>libgloss</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these tools are somewhat coupled together, so we&#x27;ll go over each
below and describe which of the above arguments each tool helps specify.</p>
<h5 id="---spec--domain-specific-language"><code>*_SPEC</code> Domain-Specific Language</h3>
<p>The lowest-level, and therefore most general, of the three languages used
in describing GCC command-line argument handling is the language used in
the various <code>*_SPEC</code> macros that targets can define. These macros
describe the transformations used to convert the command-line arguments
for every tool GCC calls, so while they&#x27;re not specific to multilib path
handling they&#x27;re used to produce the full set of argument to the linker
so I felt they were at least worth mentioning. One macro is defined for
each of the target programs: for example <code>ASM_SPEC</code> defines how to
transform command-line arguments for the assembler, <code>LINK_SPEC</code> for the
linker, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>*_SPEC</code> macros control a string-to-string transformation that
converts the command-line arguments of the <code>gcc</code> command to those passed
to another command. While I recall at some point having seen some
documentation on what can go in these macros, the best I can find right now
lives in the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Driver.html">Controlling the Compilation Driver</a>
section of the
GCC documentation. Since that doesn&#x27;t really specify how any of that
works, I&#x27;ll try to describe the bits we actually use here &ndash; most of our
port came from reading the code in other ports and from trial and error.</p>
<p>As an example of how one of these <code>*_SPEC</code> lines behaves, let&#x27;s look at
RISC-V&#x27;s <code>STARTFILE_PREFIX_SPEC</code> macro, which determines where the
linker should look for C runtime startup files like <code>crt0.o</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#define XLEN_SPEC \
  &quot;%{march=rv32*:32}&quot; \
  &quot;%{march=rv64*:64}&quot; \

#define ABI_SPEC \
  &quot;%{mabi=ilp32:ilp32}&quot; \
  &quot;%{mabi=ilp32f:ilp32f}&quot; \
  &quot;%{mabi=ilp32d:ilp32d}&quot; \
  &quot;%{mabi=lp64:lp64}&quot; \
  &quot;%{mabi=lp64f:lp64f}&quot; \
  &quot;%{mabi=lp64d:lp64d}&quot; \

#define STARTFILE_PREFIX_SPEC                   \
   &quot;&#x2F;lib&quot; XLEN_SPEC &quot;&#x2F;&quot; ABI_SPEC &quot;&#x2F; &quot;           \
   &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&quot; XLEN_SPEC &quot;&#x2F;&quot; ABI_SPEC &quot;&#x2F; &quot;       \
   &quot;&#x2F;lib&#x2F; &quot;                                     \
   &quot;&#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F; &quot;</code></pre>
<p>This is a pretty standard <code>*_SPEC</code> definition for RISC-V: they consume
the entire set of <code>gcc</code> command-line arguments as a space-separated
list, filter that through some pattern matching, perform a substitution
and then pass the result as the space-separated argument list to some
other command. We only use a handful of patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;STRING&quot;</code>: pass <code>&quot;STRING&quot;</code> directly into the output. Anything not
wrapped in <code>%{</code> and <code>}</code> is passed directly to the output.</li>
<li><code>%{argument}</code>: if <code>-argument</code> is in the input as a whole word, then
pass <code>-argument</code> to the output.</li>
<li><code>%{argument:substitution}</code>: if <code>-argument</code> is in the input as a whole
word, then pass the substitution into the output. These recurse, so
something like <code>%{arg1:%{arg2:-arg3}}</code> passes <code>-arg3</code> if both <code>-arg1</code>
and <code>-arg2</code>.</li>
<li><code>%{glob:substitution}</code>: if an argument matches <code>-glob</code>, pass
<code>substitution</code> to the output. Like above, <code>substitution</code> can be
recursive. The best reference I could find for the glob syntax is that
it looks like very simple shell globbing. For example,
<code>%{march=rv32*:32}</code> will pass <code>32</code> if passed any of <code>-march=rv32i</code>,
<code>-march=rv32imafdc</code>, or <code>-march=rv32INVALID_ISA_STRING</code> (though of
course GCC will catch the last one as part of command-line argument
parsing).</li>
<li><code>%{!glob:substitution}</code>: like the above, but passes substitution if
<code>-glob</code> isn&#x27;t present.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#x27;s about the extent of what we put in the <code>*_SPEC</code> macros used by
the RISC-V port: not all that interesting, just a bit of text pattern
matching. </p>
<ul>

<h5 id="target-fragments">Target Fragments</h3>
<p>Since the multilib path descriptions for many targets are too
complicated to be described using the spec DSL, GCC contains a second
DSL that&#x27;s used exclusively to specify the library paths in multilib
systems. There&#x27;s a bit more documentation on what this should do in
GCC&#x27;s <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Target-Fragment.html">target fragment</a>
section. To sum things up, there&#x27;s four
variables set in this file by the RISC-V port:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>: Contains the set of command-line arguments that
should be considered when expanding multilib paths. Options that are
mutually exclusive are separated by slashes, and groups of those that
are unrelated are separated by spaces.</li>
<li><code>MULTILIB_PATHS</code>: A space-separated list of the path components that
correspond to each of the above arguments. Multilib paths will be
constructed by joining the paths that correspond to the passed
arguments with slashes.</li>
<li><code>MULTILIB_MATCHES</code>: When two multilib-related arguments are similar
enough that we should use the same library paths when linking in both
modes, the mappings go in here.</li>
<li><code>MULTILIB_REQUIRED</code>: Without this argument, GCC will build libraries
that cover the cartesian product of what&#x27;s in <code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code>. On
systems where that&#x27;s too many libraries, this variable controls the
subset that&#x27;s actually built.</li>
</ul>
<p>On RISC-V we have way too many ISA&#x2F;ABI combinations to build every
combination and ship it as a library, so we heavily restrict the set that
is actually built via the <code>MULTILIB_REQUIRED</code> variable &ndash; without this
we&#x27;d end up with hundreds of libraries built, the vast majority of which
would never be used because they represent systems that don&#x27;t make a
whole lot of sense &ndash; for example, who would build a system with
double-precision floating point but no integer multiplier?</p>
<p>These variables are then provided as arguments to the <code>gcc&#x2F;genmultilib</code>
script, which produces both the tables to decode these arguments that
the <code>gcc</code> wrapper uses and the input to various build scripts that
instruct GCC to build many copies of each library it installs (for
example, <code>libgcc.so</code>).</p>
<h5 id="risc-v-s--multilib-generator--script">RISC-V&#x27;s <code>multilib-generator</code> Script</h3>
<p>RISC-V was designed to be a modular ISA. As a result we already have
over a hundred ISA and ABI combinations supported by the toolchain, and
that number will only ever increase. While we aim to support all these
combinations in the toolchain, it would be unreasonable to expect users
to build all of these libraries (or even to download all of them as part
of a distribution).</p>
<p>To fit this all into GCC&#x27;s target fragment framework we set
<code>MULTILIB_OPTIONS</code> to contain many targets and then set
<code>MULTLIB_REQUIRED</code> to the set we actually want to build. We then
slightly increase the set of supported ISA&#x2F;ABI pairs by adding some
relevant entries to <code>MULTILIB_MATCHES</code>. Since typing
all these in by hand is a pain, we instead use a script to generate our
target fragment (which in turn is the input to the <code>genmultilibs</code>
script, which then generates the input to the <code>gcc</code> compiler wrapper,
which then generates command-line arguments to <code>collect2</code> to actually
do the linking).</p>
<p>The script is called <code>multilib-generator</code> and is written in Python. It
takes a list of dash separated arguments on the command line and
produces a target fragment that implements the multilib configuration
that those arguments describe. The script isn&#x27;t really meant to be used
by end users so it&#x27;s not well documented, but if you&#x27;re trying to
produce a toolchain with a different set of multilibs than the default
set in GCC then you&#x27;ll have to deal with it.</p>
<p>Each argument is made up of four dash-separated parts. The first two
parts control the multilibs that will actually be built. For example:</p>
<pre><code># This file was generated by multilib-generator with the command:
#  .&#x2F;multilib-generator ARCH0-ABI0-- ARCH1-ABI1--
MULTILIB_OPTIONS = march=ARCH0&#x2F;march=ARCH1 mabi=ABI0&#x2F;mabi=ABI1
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES = ARCH0 \
ARCH1 ABI0 \
ABI1
MULTILIB_REQUIRED = march=ARCH0&#x2F;mabi=ABI0 \
march=ARCH1&#x2F;mabi=ABI1
MULTILIB_REUSE =</code></pre>
<p>will generate two multilibs: &quot;-march=ARCH0 -mabi=ABI0&quot; and &quot;-march=ARCH1
-mabi=ABI1&quot;. Any other march&#x2F;mabi pair will result in GCC using the default
multilib (the one just installed in &quot;lib&quot;), which will probably cause an error
when linking. This &quot;fallback to the default&quot; behavior is something baked
into GCC, and while it can be a bit problematic, we don&#x27;t have the time to
fix it right now. If you want to build an extra multilib, you should add
an additional argument to <code>multilib-generator</code> that specifies the
ISA&#x2F;ABI pair for that multilib.</p>
<pre><code># This file was generated by multilib-generator with the command:
#  .&#x2F;multilib-generator ARCH0-ABI0-ARCHa,ARCHb-
MULTILIB_OPTIONS = march=ARCH0&#x2F;march=ARCHa&#x2F;march=ARCHb mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES = ARCH0 \
ARCHa \
ARCHb ABI0
MULTILIB_REQUIRED = march=ARCH0&#x2F;mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_REUSE = march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCHa&#x2F;mabi.ABI0 \
march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCHb&#x2F;mabi.ABI0</code></pre>
<p>The next two parts control <code>MULTILIB_REUSE</code>, which specifies how GCC
searches for multilibs that don&#x27;t exactly match those built by
<code>MULTLIB_REQUIRED</code>. Both specify an additional set of comma-separated
&#x27;-march&#x27; arguments that map to the multilib specified by the first two
arguments.</p>
<p>Arguments of the third position are simpler: it&#x27;s a comma-separated list
of additional ISA values that should be mapped to the multilib specified
by the first two parts. For example:</p>
<pre><code># This file was generated by multilib-generator with the command:
#  .&#x2F;multilib-generator ARCH0-ABI0-ARCHa,ARCHb-
MULTILIB_OPTIONS = march=ARCH0&#x2F;march=ARCHa&#x2F;march=ARCHb mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES = ARCH0 \
ARCHa \
ARCHb ABI0
MULTILIB_REQUIRED = march=ARCH0&#x2F;mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_REUSE = march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCHa&#x2F;mabi.ABI0 \
march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCHb&#x2F;mabi.ABI0</code></pre>
<p>adds two additional ISAs that map the generated multilib: &quot;-march=ARCH0
-mabi=ABI0&quot; will be used when passed any of &quot;-march=ARCH0 -mabi=ABI0&quot;,
&quot;-march=ARCHa -mabi=ABI0&quot;, or &quot;-march=ARCHb -mabi=ABI0&quot;. You can
specify these when there is more than one generated multilib, the
additional ISAs apply to the multilib that&#x27;s in the same argument.</p>
<p>The fourth argument is very similar to the first, but rather than
specifying the whole ISA that should be mapped to the specified
multilib, it just specifies an additional suffix that should be mapped.
For example:</p>
<pre><code># This file was generated by multilib-generator with the command:
#  .&#x2F;multilib-generator ARCH0-ABI0--c,d
MULTILIB_OPTIONS = march=ARCH0&#x2F;march=ARCH0c&#x2F;march=ARCH0d mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_DIRNAMES = ARCH0 \
ARCH0c \
ARCH0d ABI0
MULTILIB_REQUIRED = march=ARCH0&#x2F;mabi=ABI0
MULTILIB_REUSE = march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCH0c&#x2F;mabi.ABI0 \
march.ARCH0&#x2F;mabi.ABI0=march.ARCH0d&#x2F;mabi.ABI0</code></pre>
<p>adds two additional ISAs that map the generated multilib: &quot;-march=ARCH0
-mabi=ABI0&quot; will be used when passed any of &quot;-march=ARCH0 -mabi=ABI0&quot;,
&quot;-march=ARCH0c -mabi=ABI0&quot;, or &quot;-march=ARCH0d -mabi=ABI0&quot; &ndash; as you can
see, largely the same as above</p>
<h4 id="other-multlib-aware-components">Other Multlib-Aware Components</h2>
<p>While GCC handles the vast majority of the multilib support, there&#x27;s a
handful of other components of the system that contribute in other ways
to our multilib support:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ld</code>, the linker, refuses to link objects with incompatible ABIs.
While this doesn&#x27;t directly support multilib, it does prevent it from
getting screwed up silently.</li>
<li><code>ld.so</code>, the dynamic loader, has some multilib paths baked into it so
it can search for libraries correctly. We compile one dynamic loader
for each multilib and then use GCC to fill out the corresponding ELF
interpreter field, so there&#x27;s not much going on in glibc here.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-short-way">The Short Way</h2>
<p>You might be thinking &quot;that&#x27;s super complicated, all I really want to do
here is just know which library paths are used by my compiler&quot;. While
you could derive this from looking at the GCC source code, it&#x27;s simpler
to just determine the multilib set experimentally using something like
the following script:</p>
<pre><code>#!&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash
for abi in ilp32 ilp32f ilp32d lp64 lp64f lp64d; do
  for isa in rv32e rv32i rv64i; do
    for m in &quot;&quot; m; do
      for a in &quot;&quot; a; do
        for f in &quot;&quot; f fd; do
          for c in &quot;&quot; c; do
            readlink -f $(riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=$isa$m$a$f$c -mabi=$abi -print-search-dirs | grep ^libraries | sed &#x27;s&#x2F;:&#x2F; &#x2F;g&#x27;) | grep &#x27;riscv64-unknown-elf&#x2F;lib&#x27; | grep -ve &#x27;lib$&#x27; | sed &#x27;s@^.*&#x2F;lib&#x2F;@@&#x27; | while read path; do
              echo &quot;riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=$isa$m$a$f$c -mabi=$abi =&gt; $path&quot;
            done
          done
        done
      done
    done
  done
done</code></pre>
<p>which produces the entire set of multilibs we support, along with their
corresponding arguments:</p>
<pre><code>riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 =&gt; rv32i&#x2F;ilp32

<h5 id="the-rationale-behind-our-multilib-sets">The Rationale Behind Our Multilib Sets</h3>
<p>While it may seem like the set of multilibs that are part of our default
set is somewhat arbitrary, we actually put quite a lot of thought into
each one. Most of the work here went into the embedded set, so let&#x27;s
just go through the list and describe why each one exists:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rv32i&#x2F;ilp32</code>: The simplest RISC-V ISA. While we don&#x27;t expect this to
see much commercial use, we expect that it&#x27;ll get a lot of educational
and hobbyist use. Also, it seems a bit odd not to support the base
ISA well &ndash; as otherwise what&#x27;s the point of one :).</li>
<li><code>rv32iac&#x2F;ilp32</code>: Despite there being lots of tricks to produce small
multipliers that are arbitrarily slow, some people seem to be allergic
to hardware multiplication. This target is there to satisfy those
people.</li>
<li><code>rv32im&#x2F;ilp32</code>: This exists largely to support cores retrofitted from
other ISAs where simple memory systems preclude the implementation of
both the A and C extensions.</li>
<li><code>rv32imac&#x2F;ilp32</code>: We expect this to get lots of use, it&#x27;s probably
what you&#x27;d want to build if you&#x27;re building a standalone
microcontroller chip.</li>
<li><code>rv32imafc&#x2F;ilp32f</code>: A 32-bit, floating-point target. The other option
here would have been <code>rv32imafdc&#x2F;ilp32d</code>, but we chose this instead
under the assumption that if you could deal with having a 64-bit FPU
that you&#x27;d probably just want to build a 64-bit core.</li>
<li><code>rv64imac&#x2F;lp64</code>: This will probably be the RISC-V ISA configuration that
has the largest number of cores produced for the near future, as there
aren&#x27;t any good options for deeply embedded cores (think power
management units, IP control cores, etc) that can talk to SOCs with
addresses spaces larger than 32 bits.</li>
<li><code>rv64imafdc&#x2F;lp64d</code>: The &quot;full featured&quot; embedded core. These probably
won&#x27;t be produced as embedded cores directly, but we think that people
will repurpose Linux-class cores as embedded cores as Linux isn&#x27;t that
expensive on RISC-V.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn&#x27;t want the list to become too large, so we decided to limit it
to this set. We put less thought into the Linux configurations, as
things tend to be a bit more normal in larger systems. Here we just
decided to support four library configurations: the Cartesian product of
32&#x2F;64 bit and soft&#x2F;hard float.</p>
<h4 id="changing-the-multilib-sets">Changing the Multilib Sets</h2>
<p>While we tried to ensure that a reasonable set of libraries are built as
part of the default toolchain build, you might want something slightly
different. You have a few options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a non-multilib toolchain so everything will have your ISA&#x2F;ABI
combination. This is the easiest option, but if you&#x27;re shipping
something you should at least run the GCC test suite against your
combination of choice as targets outside the default multilib set get
less testing.</li>
<li>Petition the GCC developers to add a <code>MULTILIB_MATCHES</code> that provides
a library compiled with a slightly different set of flags for the ISA
you&#x27;re interested in. This is ideal if your desired ISA doesn&#x27;t get
used much in the C library: for example, a good candidate for
addition might be to make <code>-march=rv64imafdc -mabi=lp64</code> match with
the <code>rv64imac&#x2F;lp64</code> libraries, as newlib doesn&#x27;t do much
floating-point stuff. This is low overhead, so we&#x27;ll probably accept
your suggestion.</li>
<li>Petition the GCC developers to add a <code>MULTLIB_REQUIRED</code> that provides
your desired ISA&#x2F;ABI combination. This is higher overhead than adding
to <code>MULTLIB_MATCHES</code>, as it results in a higher support burden. If
there&#x27;s commonly used silicon available for a ISA then we&#x27;ll strongly
consider adding it to the default set, as the whole point of multilib
is to avoid the need for multiple toolchains.</li>
<li>Fork the toolchain and change the default multilib set. This isn&#x27;t a
desired option, and we request if you do then you pick a different
tuple to indicate you have a non-standard build. For example, you
might pick <code>riscv64-my_company-elf</code> instead of <code>riscv64-unknown-elf</code>
to indicate that &quot;My Company&quot; is providing a non-standard toolchain.
As the <code>unknown</code> field isn&#x27;t really defined, no program should be
looking at it so you should be safe. We&#x27;d really like to avoid
toolchain forks if possible, so please at least contact us to talk
first!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&#x27;s about all there is to the RISC-V multilib implementation,
so hopefully there won&#x27;t be any more coverage on it in this blog series.
We&#x27;ll try to get back to covering slightly more interesting topics next
week :).</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20171009-linux-1-boot.html">October 09, 2017: Booting a RISC-V Linux Kernel </a> </h2>
    <p>This post begins a short detour into Linux land, during which we&#x27;ll be
discussing the RISC-V Linux kernel port. SiFive has recently accounced
the <a href="https://www.sifive.com/products/coreplex-risc-v-ip/u54-mc/">U54-MC Linux-capable coreplex</a>, and our Linux port was recently
submitted to linux-next, Linux&#x27;s staging branch, so assuming that
everything goes smoothly we should be merged at the end of the next
merge window. Along with Linux we should soon have the full suite of
core system components upstream, both for embedded systems (via
binutils, GCC, and newlib) and larger (via binutils, GCC, glibc, and
Linux).</p>
<p>This blog series will discus the Linux port as it currently stands,
which will naturally discuss various aspects of the RISC-V supervisor
spec. The hope is that this series will be useful for people interested
in hacking on the RISC-V Linux kernel port as well as people porting
other operating systems so they can see some of the design decisions we
made.</p>
<h4 id="-bbl---the-berkeley-boot-loader"><code>bbl</code>, the Berkeley Boot Loader</h2>
<p>The standard RISC-V privilege model contains four modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>User mode is where userspace programs run. This is specified by Part I
of the RISC-V ISA manual (the user specification), while all the lower
modes are specified by Part II (the supervisor specification).</li>
<li>Supervisor mode is where Linux runs.</li>
<li>Hypervisor mode is currently left unspecified.</li>
<li>Machine mode is the lowest protection mode, and is meant to run the
machine-specific firmware that may be microcode on other machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the overarching goals of the RISC-V supervisor specification is
to allow a single kernel image to run on any RISC-V platform. In order
to avoid baking assumptions about the hardware into the Linux image, we
rely on two abstraction mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The details of the underlying hardware are described by a device tree,
the standard format for describing machines that&#x27;s used by most modern
systems. This specifies the memory map, the configuration of all the
harts in the system, and how all the statically allocated devices are
attached.</li>
<li>The implementation of complicated functionality that would usually be
implemented as microcode traps is hidden behind the supervisor binary
interface, also known as the SBI. This allows supervisors like Linux
to be written to an interface provided by a lower level of the
privilege stack without the hardware complexity of adding a bunch of
emulation instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our RISC-V supervisor-mode implementation, which as far as I know is
by far the most widely used one, both the device tree and the SBI are
provided by a machine-mode shim known as the Berkeley Boot Loader (or
<code>bbl</code>). This is meant to be the first stage of the bootloader that a
user might reasonably want to replace, and maps to something like the
BIOS or EFI on a PC-style system &ndash; there are ports of both UEFI and
LinuxBIOS to RISC-V, but I know very little about them so I&#x27;ll restrict
myself to <code>bbl</code>.</p>
<p><code>bbl</code> is expected to have been chain loaded from another boot loader,
with the entry point running in machine mode. It is passed a device tree
from the prior boot loader stage, and performs the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>One hart is selected to be the main hart. The other harts are put to
sleep until <code>bbl</code> is ready to transfer control to Linux, at which
point they will all be woken up and enter Linux around the same time.</li>
<li>The device tree that was passed in from the previous stage is read and
filtered. This allows <code>bbl</code> to strip out information that Linux
shouldn&#x27;t be interested in. For example, on SiFive systems we tend to
have an extra utility hart that handles various low-level tasks like
power management. On our current systems this hart is implemented as a
very small core that lacks floating point, caches and virtual memory.
In order to avoid adding a bunch of SiFive-specific logic to Linux,
we instead just strip out the harts that Linux can&#x27;t boot.</li>
<li>All the other harts are woken up so they can setup their PMPs, trap
handlers and enter supervisor mode.</li>
<li>The <code>mhartid</code> CSR is read so Linux can be passed a unique per-hart
identifier.</li>
<li>A PMP is set up to allow supervisor mode to access all of memory.</li>
<li>Machine mode trap handlers, including a machine mode stack, is set up.
<code>bbl</code>&#x27;s machine mode code needs to handle both unimplemented
instructions and machine-mode interrupts.</li>
<li>The processor executes a <code>mret</code> to jump from machine mode to
supervisor mode.</li>
<li><code>bbl</code> jumps to the start of its payload, which in this case is Linux.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="early-boot-in-linux">Early Boot in Linux</h2>
<p>When Linux boots, it expects the system to be in the following state:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a0</code> contains a unique per-hart id. We currently map these to Linux
CPU IDs, so they&#x27;re expected to be contiguous and close to 0.</li>
<li> <code>a1</code> contains a pointer to the device tree, represented as a binary
 flattened device tree (DTB).</li>
<li>Memory is identity mapped, which <code>bbl</code> accomplishes by not enabling
paging.</li>
<li>The kernel&#x27;s ELF image has been loaded correctly, with all the various
segments at their correct addresses. This isn&#x27;t particularly onerous
for Linux, as it has a simple ELF image to load.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first thing Linux needs to do when it boots is handle an impedance
mismatch between the RISC-V specification and what Linux expects: RISC-V
systems boot harts in an arbitrary order and at arbitrary times, while
Linux expects a single hart to boot first and then wake up all other
harts. We handle this with the &quot;hart lottery,&quot; which is a very short
AMO-based sequence that picks the first hart to boot. The rest of the
harts spin, waiting for Linux to boot far enough along that they can
continue.</p>
<p>At this point we proceed with a fairly standard Linux early boot
process:</p>
<ul>
<li>A linear mapping of all physical memory is set up, with <code>PAGE_OFFSET</code>
as the offset.</li>
<li>Paging is enabled.</li>
<li>The C runtime is set up, which includes the stack and global pointers.</li>
<li>A spin-only trap vector is set up that catches any errors early in the
boot process.</li>
<li><code>start_kernel</code> is called to enter the standard Linux boot process.</li>
</ul>
<p>That concludes the entire assembly early boot section of our port &ndash; by
my count, only 71 instructions! We&#x27;re pretty proud of how little
assembly we have in our port, it serves as a testament to the simplicity
of the supervisor ISA specification.</p>
<h4 id="-setup-arch-"><code>setup_arch</code></h2>
<p>The normal Linux early boot process proceeds until we reach
<code>setup_arch</code>, which is the arch-specific setup code that&#x27;s fairly early
in the kernel boot process. On RISC-V systems, <code>setup_arch</code> proceeds to
perform the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the <code>EARLY_PRINTK</code> console, if the SBI console driver is
enabled. On RISC-V we unconditionally enable early printk because the
SBI console is well behaved so there is no reason not to enable it. As
this happens extremely early in the boot process, you get debugging
output pretty much the whole time.</li>
<li>The kernel command line is parsed, and the early arch-specific options
are dealt with. Here we only bother allowing the user to control the
amount of physical memory actually used by Linux.</li>
<li>The device tree&#x27;s memory map is parsed in order to find the kernel
image&#x27;s memory block, which is marked as reserved. The rest of the
device tree&#x27;s memory is released to the kernel for allocation.</li>
<li>The memory management subsystem is initialized, including the zero
page and various zones. We only support <code>ZONE_NORMAL</code>, so this is
quite simple.</li>
<li>Any other hart in the system is woken up.</li>
<li>The processor&#x27;s ISA is read from the device tree, which is used to
fill out the <code>HWCAP</code> field in the ELF auxvec. This allows userspace
programs to determine what the hardware they&#x27;re executing on looks
like. For now we assume a homogeneous ISA, as anything else doesn&#x27;t
really map into the UNIX model of processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the only RISC-V specific part of the boot process, after this
control returns back to the upstream kernel code.</p>
<h4 id="booting-other-harts-in-an-smp-system">Booting other Harts in an SMP System</h2>
<p>The most interesting part of the RISC-V boot process is how we wake up
other harts in the system. Recall that, on RISC-V systems, harts boot by
jumping to the kernel&#x27;s start address at arbitrary times. We do this to
simplify the specification of the ISA: if there&#x27;s no concept of a hart
that&#x27;s disabled, then there is no need to specify how to power on or off
harts. Since power management is frequently a tricky thing to handle,
we push this off to machine-specific code and provide a clean interface
to the supervisor.</p>
<p>In order to handle this wrinkle, the harts that lose the lottery spin
waiting for the main hart to make it far enough along the boot process
that they&#x27;ve been allocated the memory they need to run &ndash; in this case,
a <code>task_struct</code> that lives in the kernel&#x27;s <code>tp</code> variable (a bit of an
abuse of the thread pointer, but we just want something the compiler
won&#x27;t mangle) and a stack.</p>
<p>The code to do this is fairly straightforward, even if it is a sizeable
chunk of the assembly code in our startup function:</p>
<pre><code>.Lsecondary_start:
        li a1, CONFIG_NR_CPUS
        bgeu a0, a1, .Lsecondary_park

        &#x2F;* Set trap vector to spin forever to help debug *&#x2F;
        la a3, .Lsecondary_park
        csrw stvec, a3

        slli a3, a0, LGREG
        la a1, __cpu_up_stack_pointer
        la a2, __cpu_up_task_pointer
        add a1, a3, a1
        add a2, a3, a2</code></pre>
<p>            &#x2F;<em>
<br /></em> This hart didn&#x27;t win the lottery, so we wait for the winning hart to
             <em> get far enough along the boot process that it should continue.
<br /></em>&#x2F;
    .Lwait<em>for</em>cpu<em>up:
            REG</em>L sp, (a1)
            REG<em>L tp, (a2)
            beqz sp, .Lwait</em>for<em>cpu</em>up
            beqz tp, .Lwait<em>for</em>cpu<em>up
            fence
<br />
            &#x2F;<em> Enable virtual memory and relocate to virtual address </em>&#x2F;
            call relocate
<br />
            tail smp</em>callin</p>
<p>This leaves the <code>__cpu_up</code> function, which boots a target hard by ID,
also to be fairly simple:</p>
<pre><code>int __cpu_up(unsigned int cpu, struct task_struct *tidle)
{
        tidle-&gt;thread_info.cpu = cpu;

        &#x2F;*
         * On RISC-V systems, all harts boot on their own accord.  Our _start
         * selects the first hart to boot the kernel and causes the remainder
         * of the harts to spin in a loop waiting for their stack pointer to be
         * setup by that main hart. Writing __cpu_up_stack_pointer signals to
         * the spinning harts that they can continue the boot process.
         *&#x2F;
        smp_mb();
        __cpu_up_stack_pointer[cpu] = task_stack_page(tidle) + THREAD_SIZE;
        __cpu_up_task_pointer[cpu] = tidle;

        while (!cpu_online(cpu))
                cpu_relax();

        return 0;
}</code></pre>
<h4 id="shutting-down">Shutting Down</h2>
<p>It seems most natural to discuss the shutdown process along with the
boot process, but the process is actually very simple on RISC-V: the
generic kernel code cleans up the whole kernel, at which
point <code>sbi_shutdown</code> is called to inform the machine-mode code that it
should terminate.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s about all that&#x27;s involved in booting (and halting) a RISC-V Linux
kernel. Since we use device tree and push most of the platform-specific
work into the firmware, the process is actually pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>Next week we&#x27;ll discuss task switching, which is the first thing the
kernel does after the boot process completes.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20171023-linux-2-tasks.html">October 23, 2017: Entering and Exiting the Linux Kernel on RISC-V </a> </h2>
    <p>Continuing our journey into the RISC-V Linux kernel port, this week
we&#x27;ll discuss context switching. Context switching is one of the more
important parts of an architecture port: it is all but impossible to
completely abstract away the details of entering and exiting the kernel,
Since this is on many critical paths (system calls and scheduling) it
must go fast, but since it&#x27;s the one line of protection the kernel has
from userspace it must also be secure.</p>
<h4 id="traps-on-risc-v-systems">Traps on RISC-V Systems</h2>
<p>One of the more interesting things about the RISC-V ISA is that there is
very little that happens when taking an interrupt or exception. In
addition to making the ISA simple to implement, this has the advantage
of allowing software to have a clean slate on top of which to implement
context switching.</p>
<p>The RISC-V supervisor specification defines a single kernel trap entry
point, which can be set by writing the <code>stvec</code> CSR. The only way to
transfer control to the kernel is via this entry point, and the only
side effects of taking a trap are to change the PC, the exception PC and
exception cause CSRs,  and the privilege mode. The supervisor software
is expected to provide a transparent implementation of the userspace
ABI.</p>
<p>Just like entering the kernel via a single trap entry point, the only
way to leave the kernel is by executing the <code>sret</code> instruction. This
mirrors taking a trap: all that happens is the privilege mode is changed
and the PC is reset to the exception PC CSR&#x27;s value. Again, the
supervisor software is expected to provide a transparent implementation
of the userspace ABI.</p>
<p>The one additional bit of support for supervisor mode trap handling that
exists in the RISC-V ISA is the <code>sscratch</code> CSR. This CSR provides a
single XLEN-sized save region that has no implicit behavior and thus is
entirely used at the supervisor&#x27;s discretion. All our software context
switching implementations use this register to store a pointer to a
memory region that contains whatever extra information is actually
required to make the context switch, essentially just pushing the entire
context switching implementation into software.</p>
<h5 id="trap-delegation">Trap Delegation</h3>
<p>The RISC-V ISA defines that all traps are handled by machine mode by
default, with the option to delegate traps in some privilege levels by
directly handling them in their respective privilege level. The
supervisor mode software is oblivious to the mechanism used to enter its
trap handler, it simply assumes that the relevant traps eventually make
it to supervisor mode.</p>
<p>Machine mode software is expected to either filter traps in hardware or
software. For example, if the machine mode implementation has emulation
routines for some unsupported instructions, it would have to handle the
illegal instruction trap in software but could delegate the remaining
traps via the hardware mechanism.</p>
<p>The trap delegation mechanism allows high performance traps by
delegating them directly to supervisor mode in hardware while still
allowing the flexibility of handling any trap in a lower privilege mode.
This allows for a simple implementation of virtual machines while still
allowing for high performance on implementations that don&#x27;t utilize
virtualisation.</p>
<h5 id="--handle-exception----the-trap-entry-point"><code>handle_exception</code>, the Trap Entry Point</h3>
<p>Since most of the interesting aspects of context switching on RISC-V
systems are handled by the supervisor mode software, the hardware enters
the kernel at one single trap entry point and then the supervisor-mode
software determines how to handle the trap. There are two categories of
traps defined by the RISC-V ISA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interrupts, which are asynchronous. RISC-V defines a software
interrupt, a timer interrupt, and an external interrupt.</li>
<li>Exceptions, which are synchronous. RISC-V defines exceptions to
handle instruction, load, store, and AMO access faults; environment
calls (used for system calls on Linux); illegal instructions; and
breakpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>The trap type is determined by the <code>scause</code> CSR upon entry to the trap
handler. After saving the integer registers to the kernel stack, which
can be looked up via <code>sscratch</code>, we examine the trap cause and determine
how to handle the trap. RISC-V delineates interrupts by setting the
high bit in <code>scause</code>, which makes it easy to filter those out and handle
them. As most exceptions result from userspace emitting an <code>scall</code>
instruction to begin a system call, we then check for that condition and
handle the system call using Linux&#x27;s generic system call handling
infrastructure. The remainder of the exceptions and handled via a jump
table, each having a fairly straight-forward implementation that passes
control back to the kernel&#x27;s relevant generic exception handling
routine.</p>
<h5 id="isa-defined-interrupts">ISA-Defined Interrupts</h3>
<p>All the exception-type traps are very simple to handle on RISC-V because
we essentially just pass control directly back to the relevant generic
Linux routine. Interrupts are, however, a different story: as far as I
can tell, there isn&#x27;t any generic infrastructure to handle the first
level of interrupt muxing we have on RISC-V so at least for the time
being we have our own mechanism. What we have now is a bit messy, so
while I&#x27;m going to describe what&#x27;s going on here it&#x27;s all in flux and
may have changed by the time you read this blog entry.</p>
<p>The best way to describe why this is messy is to walk through the timer
interrupt as an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SEE implementation determines a timer interrupt has occurred and
enters the supervisor&#x27;s trap handler with <code>scause</code> set accordingly,
which in Linux is <code>handle_exception</code>.</li>
<li>Linux determines this is an interrupt by looking at a bit in <code>scause</code>
and then calls <code>do_IRQ</code> to handle the interrupt.</li>
<li><code>do_IRQ</code> calls in to the RISC-V interrupt controller driver&#x27;s
interrupt handling function, <code>riscv_intc_irq</code>. This is the first bit
of messiness: our core arch port is tied to one of our drivers via a
RISC-V specific API, which is generally a bad idea.</li>
<li><code>riscv_intc_irq</code> determines this is a timer interrupt, which then
calls back into the core RISC-V arch port to handle the timer
interrupt via <code>riscv_timer_interrupt</code>. This is another RISC-V specific
API, but this one is a bit less scary because the dependency is
from the driver to the arch port, which will be hard to avoid.</li>
<li><code>riscv_timer_interrupt</code> looks into the RISC-V timer driver&#x27;s percpu
data structure to find the relevant <code>struct clock_event_device</code>, which
it then call to handle the timer interrupt. This is yet another
dependency from our arch port into a driver, which is also a bad idea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Intertwining our arch port with our drivers is generally a bad idea.
While we used to have our drivers much more tightly ingrained with our
arch port and are in the process of cleaning this up, there&#x27;s still a
bit more work to do in order to get this all sane.</p>
<h5 id="the-plic">The PLIC</h3>
<p>In stark contrast to how our first-level interrupt handling flow works,
the PLIC driver has a fairly clean interrupt handling flow. Registering
the PLIC driver is handled entirely via standard device tree mechanisms,
and handling interrupts doesn&#x27;t touch any core RISC-V code.</p>
<p><code>plic_init</code>, the PLIC driver initialization function, hooks into Linux&#x27;s
<code>irqchip</code> device tree infrastructure so it can be called when a PLIC
exists in the device tree. The PLIC interrupt mappings are also
specified by the device tree, so in order to register the various
interrupt handlers all the PLIC driver needs to do is hook into Linux&#x27;s
generic IRQ registration subsystem to link a PLIC interrupt to whatever
device driver it should trigger.</p>
<p>The actual PLIC interrupt handling flow is fairly simple: since the PLIC
is designed with modern multi-core interrupt handling flows in mind,
there aren&#x27;t a whole lot of hoops we need to jump through in order to
handle an interrupt. The general PLIC interrupt handling flow is as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A given (hart context, interrupt id) pair is enabled. In the current
Linux driver we simply support globally enabling interrupts for the
time being, but the PLIC is designed to allow per-hart interrupt
routing at some point in the future.</li>
<li>While the PLIC hardware allows for priorities and thresholds, we
currently don&#x27;t support these in the Linux driver. Thus we simply
configure the threshold to allow all interrupts in and enable or
disable them upon request.</li>
<li>Once interrupts are enabled and the device eventually triggers an
interrupt, the PLIC will pick one hart context (where the triggered
interrupt is enabled and over the context&#x27;s threshold) to interrupt by
raising the local interrupt controller&#x27;s external interrupt line, thus
causing control to enter the kernel&#x27;s trap entry point and eventually
filter to the interrupt handling routine that the PLIC driver
registered.</li>
<li>As is common in many interrupt handling flows, the external interrupt
raised by the PLIC simply means &quot;there may be an arbitrary amount of
work to do, you should go check now&quot;. When handling PLIC interrupts,
this triggers an interrupt handling loop that has three phases.
  <em> First the driver polls this hart&#x27;s interrupt claim register via
    the <code>plic_claim</code> function. This memory mapped read serves as a
    synchronization point: it both informs software of a pending
    interrupt that should be handled (with the sentinal value of 0
    reserved to terminate the handling loop) and allows the PLIC
    hardware to ensure that an interrupt is processed by only a single
    hart context.
<br /></em> The PLIC driver then maps the PLIC&#x27;s IRQ number to the
    cooresponding Linux interrupt handler (via Linux&#x27;s generic IRQ
    subsystem) and then allows Linux to handle the interrupt.
  * To finish an interrupt, the PLIC driver then informs the PLIC
    hardware that it&#x27;s done handling the interrupt via the
    <code>plic_complete</code> function, which writes the interrupt ID back to
    the claim register. This re-enables the interrupt in the PLIC,
    allow it to be handled again.</li>
<li>The PLIC driver continues handling interrupts as long as there are
pending interrupts returned by <code>plic_claim</code>, which allows multiple
interrupts to be handled without introducing additional context
switches.</li>
<li>Once the PLIC driver determines that there are no more pending
interrupts, it informs the generic IRQ handling subsystem that it&#x27;s
done handling interrupts for now and then returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PLIC driver as it currently stands is in pretty decent shape, but
there are a handful of small cleanups that could be performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PLIC assumes that the interrupt source IDs can be registered
globally in Linux, which may conflict with other interrupt controllers
in the system. Right now we only have the local interrupt controller,
which doesn&#x27;t register with the generic IRQ handling subsystem, so
this may change.</li>
<li>The PLIC hardware supports AMOs and is designed to have an efficient
software implementation that uses AMOs to enable and disable
interrupts. Since we currently can&#x27;t query PMAs on RISC-V systems to
ensure that Linux can actually use AMOs to talk to the PLIC, we don&#x27;t
take advantage of this in the PLIC driver right now.</li>
<li>The PLIC uses the simple IRQ handling flow, but it may map better to
the FastEOI flow. This would allow us to clean up the PLIC driver&#x27;s
implementation by hoisting the interrupt polling loop out of RISC-V
specific code and use the generic version instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully we&#x27;ll have some of these issues resolved by the time the PLIC
driver is upstream, but as many of the issues are fairly minor we might
take a bit to clean everything up.</p>
<h5 id="saving-and-restoring-extension-state">Saving and Restoring Extension State</h3>
<p>RISC-V was designed to be an extensible ISA, and as a result it has
multiple extensions. Linux is largely oblivious to these extensions: it
mandates the A extension and will probably run on systems with the M and
C extensions, but as those extensions don&#x27;t have any extra state these
are easy things to handle.</p>
<p>The only current extension defined by the RISC-V standard that adds to
the user-visible state are the F and D extensions, which add floating
point registers. The RISC-V floating point extensions follow the
standard pattern: Linux is able to mark the register state as &quot;trap on
access&quot; so it can lazily save and restote the F register state. This has
one major advantage: since the F register state will never be dirty on
systems without F registers, we don&#x27;t need any explicit code in the
Linux kernel to distinguish between systems with or without the F
extension.</p>
<h5 id="returning-to-userspace">Returning to Userspace</h3>
<p>Returning to userspace on RISC-V systems is fairly straight-forward:
since the hardware does very little on a context switch, we just reverse
everything that happened when entering the kernel and issue a <code>sret</code>
instruction to get back to userspace.</p>
<p>There are a handful of Linux-specific things we need to do before
returning to userspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we&#x27;re returning from a system call, we need to check to see if
syscall tracing is enabled. This allows the ptrace interface to work,
which is the kernel interface used by programs like GDB and strace.</li>
<li>Before returning to userspace in any manner, we heck to see if there&#x27;s
other work that should be done before entering userspace, invoking
either some signal handlers or the scheduler as necessary.</li>
<li><code>tp</code> is swapped with <code>sscratch</code>, so the kernel can find its internal
data structures again when it is re-entered.</li>
<li>Restore userspace&#x27;s copies of the integer register state and jump back
to userspace.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="signal-handling">Signal Handling</h2>
<p>Since signal handling is one of the more complicated aspects of Linux,
we try to avoid deviating too much from the standard asm-generic
mechanisms. The RISC-V signal handling infrastructure is primarily
based around passing a <code>struct sigcontext</code> to userspace, which contains
the user&#x27;s architectural state at the time of the exception (as saved by
the kernel), to the signal handler function registered by userspace.</p>
<p>Userspace&#x27;s signal handler function has the same ABI as a regular
function. This makes it easy to enter the signal handler: we simply
modify <code>sepc</code> to contain the address of the signal handler and then
return to userspace via the normal mechanisms. Signal handlers are
expected to call <code>sigreturn</code> when they are done, so in order to maintain
the regular function ABI we set the return link to a VDSO-based
trampoline function that does so.</p>
<p>Since <code>struct sigcontext</code> contains a copy of all the user-visible
architecture-defined state at the time the signal to be handled was
taken, this needs to be extensible in order to allow for future RISC-V
ISA extensions to cleanly integrate with applications that need to
interrogate these contexts. In order to enable these applications we
have defined an extensible format for <code>struct sigcontext</code> that allows
these future extensions to be made visible to userspace. We currently
only support the F and D extensions, but we&#x27;ve designed this with the
eventual V extension in mind as well.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for next week, where we&#x27;ll talk about how the RISC-V kernel
port handles memory management.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20171204-linux_upstream.html">December 04, 2017: The RISC-V Linux Port is Upstream! </a> </h2>
    <p>As some of you may have heard, the RISC-V Linux port has been accepted
into Linus&#x27; tree and is slated to release as part of 4.15. While this
is a major milestone, we&#x27;re far from done in Linux kernel land and
there&#x27;s a whole lot of work left to be done in userspace.</p>
<p>That said, this is a big enough development that it warrants a blog post
of its own &ndash; at the least as an excuse for why I haven&#x27;t been blogging
for a bit :).</p>
<h4 id="what-is-upstream-">What is Upstream?</h2>
<p>The core of our port has landed upstream.  That includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device Tree bindings for RISC-V CPUs.</li>
<li>Early boot and initialization code.</li>
<li>The Linux atomic and memory model intrinsics, targeted at a non-formal
memory model (aka, a bunch of guesses I&#x27;ve made).</li>
<li>Some interrupt and timer infrastructure, but this needs to be cleaned
up.</li>
<li>Paging and MMU related code.</li>
<li>An implementation of the user-facing ABIs for RISC-V Linux systems,
which will be turned into a specification.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this code, in addition to a handful of fixups, will be included in
the 4.15 tarball release. We&#x27;re targeting the next glibc release, which
should be out in early February. At that point, the ABIs will be set in
stone and distributions will be able to begin work while maintaining
binary forever.</p>
<h4 id="what-isn-t-upstream-">What isn&#x27;t Upstream?</h2>
<p>We&#x27;re still missing quite a few features, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to clean up first-level interrupt handling on RISC-V systems,
which I will probably borrow from how ARMv8 and OpenRISC are doing it.</li>
<li>The SBI console driver isn&#x27;t upstream yet, but it appears to be in
pretty good shape.</li>
<li>The per-hart interrupt controller will need to be modified to work
with the new interrupt handling scheme.</li>
<li>The PLIC driver should be converted to the FastEOI flow, but I&#x27;ve yet
to finish that refactoring.</li>
<li>The ISA mandated timer driver needs to be converted to avoid
initialization code in <code>arch&#x2F;riscv&#x2F;</code>, to handle more of the device
tree specification, and to use the new interrupt handling
infrastructure.</li>
<li>Our 32-bit DMA patches need to be cleanup up and submitted for review.</li>
<li>We have some workarounds for bugs in the Xilinx PCIe controller that
need to be fixed sanely .</li>
<li>There&#x27;s a handful of cleanups floating around in PCI and OF land that
need to eventually make it in.  Some of these were also being worked
on in better ways by upstream, so hopefully that sorts itself out.</li>
<li>We have a handful of device tree documentation fixes that should go
in.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="how-to-help">How to Help</h2>
<p>If you&#x27;re interested in helping with the RISC-V Linux effort (or any
other RISC-V software project), the best place to get started is on our
<a href="http://github.com/riscv/">GitHub</a> page. Each project has its own
development repository on GitHub that contains various outstanding
patches, and the RISC-V maintainers of those projects are active on
those GitHub pages to discuss development.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re already familiar with the development process for a particular
project, then we of course follow the standard development practices on
a per-project basis for all the ports that have landed upstream. In
general, a <code>MAINTAINERS</code> file of some sort will contain the mechanism
for contacting the RISC-V developers. There is also a
<code>patches@groups.riscv.org</code> mailing list where all patches for upstream
RISC-V software are meant to be CC&#x27;d &ndash; this is mainly meant for
distribution maintainers as an easy place to find all software patches,
but also serves as a place for discussion.</p>
<p>Additionally, for questions that don&#x27;t fit into any of the above bins
you&#x27;re welcome to send them to the RISC-V software mailing list,

    <h2> <a href="blog/20171211-linux-3-priv.html">December 11, 2017: Paging and the MMU in the RISC-V Linux Kernel </a> </h2>
    <p>This entry will cover the RISC-V port of Linux&#x27;s memory management
subsystem. Since the vast majority of the memory management code in
Linux is architecture-independent, the vast majority of our memory
management code handles interfacing with our MMU, defining our page
table format, and interfacing with drivers that have memory allocation
constraints.</p>
<p>I will refrain from discussing the RISC-V memory model in this blog,
both because it isn&#x27;t yet finished and because it&#x27;s complicated enough
to warrant its own series of blog posts.</p>
<p>Also, as a side note: for those of you not following the internet, we&#x27;ve
gotten our core architecture port into Linus&#x27; tree and are slated to
release as part of 4.15.  This won&#x27;t be a fully bootable RISC-V system,
but it&#x27;s at least a good first step!</p>
<h4 id="privilege-levels-in-risc-v-systems">Privilege Levels in RISC-V Systems</h2>
<p>The RISC-V ISA defines a stack of execution environments. While each
environment is designed to be classically virtualizable, in standard
systems each level in the stack is designed to provide the next level&#x27;s
execution environment. Starting from the least-privileged level in the
stack, the execution environments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-mode software executes in an AEE (Application Execution
Environment). On Linux systems, the AEE is also known as the user
ABI: the set of system calls supported by the kernel. The AEE also
includes the entire user ISA, since user-mode programs are expected to
be able to execute instructions other than just <code>scall</code>.</li>
<li>Supervisor-mode software executes in an SEE (Supervisor Execution
Environment). This environment consists of the supervisor-mode
instructions and CSRs defined by the privileged ISA document, along
with the SBI. Supervisor-mode software is expected to provide
multiple AEEs, Linux provides one AEE to each process.</li>
<li>Hypervisor-mode software executes in an HEE (Hypervisor Execution
Environment), and is expected to provide multiple SEEs. The
hypervisor-mode section of the privileged ISA document is still being
written, so we&#x27;ll ignore this for now.</li>
<li>Machine-mode software executes in an MEE (Machine Execution
Environment), and is expected to provide one higher-level execution
context. Since the privileged mode ISA makes implementing the U, S,
and H extensions optional (thus allowing for M, M+U, M+S+U, and
M+H+S+U systems), it&#x27;s expected that different machine-mode software
implementation will provide either an HEE, SEE, or AEE.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&#x27;s fairly standard to provide execution environment stacks that
do not match this hierarchy, the software executing in each environment
can&#x27;t tell the difference. That&#x27;s not to say that user-mode software is
entirely portable: for example, the Linux AEE is different than the
FreeBSD AEE because they provide different system calls. The intent is
simply that programs written to execute in the Linux AEE can&#x27;t tell if
they&#x27;re executing on Linux on hardware, in Linux running in Spike, or in
QEMU&#x27;s user-mode emulation. None of this is a new concept, it&#x27;s just a
bit more explicitly stated in the RISC-V ISA specification than it is on
many other architectures.</p>
<p>Since RISC-V is classically virtualizable at every level of the privilege
stack, no explicit hardware support is necessary to provide any
execution environment: for example, QEMU&#x27;s user-mode emulation provides
an AEE on systems that have no hardware support for any RISC-V ISA.
While these systems can be made reasonably performant, the main purpose
of RISC-V is to enable hardware implementations of the ISA &ndash; for
example, even though a Xeon running QEMU will probably be the fastest
implementation of the RISC-V Linux AEE for the foreseeable future it
would be more appropriate to run a hardware implementation of RISC-V on
my wristwatch.</p>
<p>The RISC-V ISA documents are designed to allow the software
implementations at various levels of the privilege stack to use the
execution environment they&#x27;re written against in order to provide the
execution environment above them. Some of these are so obvious you
probably haven&#x27;t noticed that we&#x27;ve been talking about them for a while:
for example, it&#x27;s assumed that the hardware handles executing an <code>addi</code>
instruction in userspace without the kernel&#x27;s intervention because it
would be silly not to.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve been able to put off the discussion of privileged levels until now
because the vast majority of the design is obvious: all of the user
instructions are handled by the hardware without supervisor intervention
except for <code>scall</code>, which just transfers control to the kernel&#x27;s single
trap entry point &ndash; see my <a href="all-aboard-part-7-entering-and-exiting-the-linux-kernel-on-risc-v">previous blog post</a> for
details. Since application execution environments provide the illusion
that user-space programs have access to a big flat address space we&#x27;ve
been able to more or less ignore memory when discussing user
applications. As is common with computing systems, memory is the hard
part &ndash; thus, we only really need to discuss RISC-V privilege modes when
talking about paging.</p>
<p>For this blog post, we&#x27;ll be focusing on supervisor code running on
reasonable systems &ndash; thus we won&#x27;t do things like emulating unsupported
instructions from userspace. The focus of the blog will be on how to
provide a RISC-V application execution environment given a supervisor
execution environment.</p>
<h5 id="the-risc-v-application-class-supervisor-execution-environments">The RISC-V Application-Class Supervisor Execution Environments</h3>
<p>Supervisor programs, like Linux, execute on a supervisor execution
environment. Much like how the user-level ISA leaves many of the
specifics of the AEE to be implemented in different ways on different
platforms (system calls on Linux vs BSD, for example), the privileged
ISA doesn&#x27;t specify all the details of the SEE that application-class
supervisors (like Linux or BSD) can expect &ndash; those will be specified as
part of the platform specification.</p>
<p>In this blog, I&#x27;ll quickly go over a few key aspects of the RISC-V
supervisor execution environment for application-class supervisors.
This environment is designed to support UNIX-style operating systems
running in supervisor mode, emulating POSIX-compliant application
execution environments. A highlight of the proposed (with the caveat
that I&#x27;m not in the platform specification working group, so this is all
just my guess) requirements of the application-class SEE are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either the RV32I or RV64I base ISAs, along with the M, A, and C
extensions. The F and D extensions are optional but paired together,
leaving the possible standard ISAs for application-class SEEs as
RV32IMAC, RV32IMAFDC (RV32GC), RV64IMAC, and RV64IMAFDC (RV64GC).</li>
<li>On RV32I-based systems, support for Sv32 page-based virtual memory.</li>
<li>On RV64I-based systems, support for at least Sv48 page-based virtual
memory.</li>
<li>Upon entering the SEE, the PMAs are set such that memory accesses are
point-to-point strongly ordered between harts and devices.</li>
<li>An SBI that implements various fences, timers, and a console.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application-class SEE, as specified by the upcoming RISC-V platform
specification, in the contract between standard Linux distributions and
hardware vendors &ndash; of course these restrictions don&#x27;t apply for the
embedded space, where many of them would be onerous. In practice: if
you expect users to be able to swap out the boot media on your platform,
then you should meet the requirements of the application-class SEE.</p>
<h5 id="the-risc-v-linux-application-execution-environments">The RISC-V Linux Application Execution Environments</h3>
<p>Supervisor-mode software on RISC-V uses a supervisor execution
environment in order to provide one or multiple application execution
environments. Fundamentally, an AEE (like any execution environment) is
simply the definition of the next state of the machine upon every
instruction&#x27;s execution. On RISC-V systems, the AEE depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ISA string, which determines what the vast majority of
instructions do as well as which registers constitute the machine&#x27;s
current state.</li>
<li>The supervisor&#x27;s user-visible ABI, which determines what the <code>scall</code>
instruction does.  This is different than the C compiler&#x27;s ABI, which
defines the interface between different components of the application.</li>
<li>The contents of the entire memory address space.</li>
</ul>
<p>In an idealized world, each process consists of its own independent AEE,
with Linux multiplexing these on top of a single SEE.  Of course,
there&#x27;s all sort of problems to this model in practice, but none of this
is specific to RISC-V systems.  The concept of a self-contained and well
defined AEE is still useful from a standards standpoint, and we hope to
progress on properly specifying the RISC-V Linux AEE family (as well as
AEEs for other POSIX-like systems) as we progress with our ports.</p>
<h4 id="paging-on-risc-v-systems">Paging on RISC-V Systems</h2>
<p>After that lengthy divergence into the definition of RISC-V&#x27;s privileged
modes, we can finally get to the whole point of this blog post: paging
on RISC-V systems. Paging is the main mechanism used to provide user
mode with the illusion of having an AEE &ndash; like most things in computer
architecture, it turns out that memory is the tricky part.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about designing an ISA at the time RISC-V was
designed is that so many different solutions to difficult problems have
been tried that we pretty much know what to do now.  Thus, we arrived at
a pretty standard page-based virtual memory system when designing the
RISC-V&#x27;s supervisor virtual memory interface.  The exact page table
formats and such are listed in the relevant RISC-V ISA manuals so I
won&#x27;t go through them here, but there are a few highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pages are 4KiB at the leaf node, and it&#x27;s possible to map large
contiguous regions with every level of the page table.</li>
<li>RV32I-based systems can have up to 34-bit physical addresses with a
three level page table.</li>
<li>RV64I-based systems can have multiple virtual address widths, starting
with 39-bit and extending up to 64-bit in increments of 9 bits.</li>
<li>Mappings must be synchronized via the <code>sfence.vma</code> instruction.</li>
<li>There are bits for global mappings, supervisor-only,
read&#x2F;write&#x2F;execute, and accessed&#x2F;dirty.</li>
<li>There is a single valid bit, which allows storing <code>XLEN-1</code> bits of
flags in an otherwise unused page tables.  Additionally, there are two
bits of software flags in mapped pages.</li>
<li>Address space identifiers are 9 bits or RV32I and 16 bits on RV64I,
and they&#x27;re a hint so a valid implementation is to ignore them.</li>
<li>The accessed and dirty bits are strongly ordered with respect to
accesses from the same hart, but are optional (with a trap-based
mechanism when unsupported).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Linux implementation of paging is functional but not complete: we&#x27;re
missing support for ASIDs, for example.  Like many things in our port,
these extra features will come with time.</p>
<h4 id="handling-device-dma">Handling Device DMA</h2>
<p>RISC-V does not currently define an IOMMU, so device accesses are
performed in a single linear address space provided by the SEE (aka,
physical memory).  Combined with the lack of a mechanism to modify PMAs,
this makes device IO on RISC-V very simple: we essentially just don&#x27;t do
anything specific to our ISA.</p>
<h5 id="handling-32-bit-dma-regions">Handling 32-bit DMA Regions</h3>
<p>Some devices only support 32-bit addressing even when attached to a
system with longer physical addresses.  Since RISC-V lacks an IOMMU, we
handle these devices by using kernel bounce buffers.  This is correct
but slow: while it may be fine for SoC-style systems where the set of
devices is well known at elaboration time, as more complicated RISC-V
systems become available we will eventually need to standardize a
mechanism for virtualizing device addressing.</p>
<p>Our bounce buffer mechanism simply uses the standard mechanisms provided
by Linux, so there isn&#x27;t anything RISC-V specific about it.  We provide
a 32-bit <code>ZONE_DMA</code>, allow allocating from that, and use bounce buffers
to handle <code>ioremap()</code> for already-allocated pages outside the legal
region.</p>

    
    <h2> <a href="blog/20180220-contribute_to_riscv_software.html">February 20, 2018: How to Contribute to the RISC-V Software Ecosystem </a> </h2>
    <p>We recently announced the <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sifive/hifive-unleashed">HiFive
Unleashed</a>, a
development board for Freedom U540-G000, the world&#x27;s first Linux-capable
RISC-V ASIC. The announcement of this board roughly lined up with the
first upstream releases of Linux and glibc that contain RISC-V support.
As a result, our news has driven a lot of interest from the open source
software community &ndash; that was really the whole point of announcing the
board in the first place, so in that sense it&#x27;s working out very well.</p>
<p>This new wave of interest has demonstrated that we don&#x27;t have nearly
enough information on how RISC-V software development is done.  We&#x27;re
essentially in the same situation again as to what prompted starting
this blog, but with a new set of tools: I originally started the blog
when binutils and GCC landed upstream with descriptions of how those
ports work for developers who became interested after those ports were
released. We now have a whole new set of interested developers who found
our Linux and glibc ports and want to know how to get involved.</p>
<p>While there are some technical descriptions of how the RISC-V binutils,
GCC, and Linux ports are structured, there is no description of how our
development flow works. Since our launch, we maintained out-of-tree RISC-V
ports for a long time, and it&#x27;s a bit confusing for new developers just
starting with RISC-V as there are a lot of odd practices we used to use
while maintaining our out-of-tree ports that we&#x27;re slowly phasing out.
After getting a handful of emails from people asking how they should
contribute (including some from SiFive employees :)), I thought it&#x27;d be
best to describe our development flows.</p>
<p>Now that we&#x27;re upstream, the development flow is actually very simple:
you can contribute to the RISC-V port of a project in exactly the same
way you&#x27;d contribute to any other port of that project.  Thus, if
you&#x27;re already familiar with how a project&#x27;s development flow works then
just keep doing what you&#x27;re doing &ndash; we read all the relevant mailing
lists and bug trackers.It &#x27;s generally best to indicate your patches
are RISC-V related with a subject that looks something like &quot;[PATCH]
RISC-V: Fix a bug in...&quot; to make sure your email doesn&#x27;t get lost in the
flood.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re not familiar with upstream development for a project, are
looking for a more concrete list of things that need to get done, or are
interested in distributing RISC-V software then feel free to keep
reading :).</p>
<h4 id="backports--repositories--branch-names--and-tagged-releases">Backports, Repositories, Branch Names, and Tagged Releases</h2>
<p>We&#x27;ve been trying to follow the same branching and release scheme in all
the projects that I maintain, which currently include
binutils, GCC, glibc and Linux. We have the following branches (using
binutils for reference, as it&#x27;s the first on the list):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>master</code> (or <code>trunk</code>, for SVN-based projects like GCC): The main
development branch.</li>
<li><code>riscv-all</code>: The RISC-V integration branch, which is based on the master
and contains additional patches of any quality level. This branch
might not be stable or high quality, but if you&#x27;ve found a bug then
you should look through this branch to see if there&#x27;s an in progress
patch to fix it to avoid duplicating work.  I don&#x27;t recommend working
directly off this branch as it is automatically generated and churns a
lot.</li>
<li><code>binutils-2_30-branch</code>: The upstream release branch. We backport
RISC-V patches to this branch when appropriate.  Note that the
backport criteria tend to be fairly stringent here: the patch must
have gone through upstream&#x27;s code review, and must be a bug fix. That
means feature additions and performance improvements generally aren&#x27;t
appropriate for backport to the upstream release branch.</li>
<li><code>riscv-binutils-2.30</code>: The RISC-V release branch. This is based on
the actual release from upstream (as opposed to the release branch,
which moves) and contains as many RISC-V specific backports as
possible. This includes backports that aren&#x27;t suitable for upstream,
such as new features and performance improvements, as long as they&#x27;re
straightforward to backport to older versions of the package. We
maintain this branch for one release cycle. If you&#x27;re looking to
distribute RISC-V software then this is the best place to look: it&#x27;s
where SiFive&#x27;s binary toolchain releases come from and what ends up
tagged as stable.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all these branches it&#x27;s important to ensure that patches end up
properly tracked. Thus we have a bit of process involved in tracking
the lifecycle of a patch as it moves from a work-in-progress to a
binary release. The life-cycle of a patch is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new <code>wip-feature_name</code> branch in your personal repository
while working on your feature. If you&#x27;re a regular contributor you
can submit a pull request to add your repository to the list of places
that <code>riscv-all</code> is generated from in
<a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux-infra">riscv-linux-infra</a>.</li>
<li>When you think your patch is in good enough shape to be merged
upstream, submit it. You can either submit a pull request on github
against <code>master</code>, or send a patch via email.</li>
<li>The patch will be collected and merged upstream.</li>
<li>If your patch should be backported to the upstream release branch,
submit another pull request (against <code>binutils-2_30-branch</code>) or send
another email (indicating it&#x27;s a backport) asking for the patch to be
backported.</li>
<li>If your patch shouldn&#x27;t be backported to the upstream release branch but
should be backported to the RISC-V specific release branch (in this
case <code>riscv-binutils-2.30</code>), submit another pull request against that
branch with your patch.</li>
<li>Eventually we will tag a RISC-V specific release with your patch in
it, at which point it will be picked up by distributions (including
the SiFive binary toolchain releases).</li>
</ul>
<p>While I&#x27;m trying to impose this flow on all the projects I&#x27;m heavily
involved with, there are a few differences between the projects in order
to adapt them to the relevent upstream development flows.</p>
<h4 id="gnu-toolchain--binutils--gcc--and-glibc-">GNU Toolchain (binutils, GCC, and glibc)</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the code for our toolchains, both for embedded
systems (based on newlib) and Linux (based on glibc), has been committed
upstream and lives at the relevant FSF repositories.  Specifically, that
means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our binutils port lives in the <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git">sourceware.org git
repository</a>.
In addition to binutils this repository contains the GDB and SIM
ports, but we haven&#x27;t quite gotten those merged upstream yet so these
still exist as backports in the <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-binutils-gdb">RISC-V GitHub
Repository</a>. In addition
to the GDB and SIM ports, our GitHub repository also contains the
RISC-V specific backport branches.</li>
<li>Our GCC port lives in the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/gcc/">gcc.gnu.org SVN
repository</a>. Aside from day-to-day
work, our whole port can be found in this upstream repository. We
additionally mantain a <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc">git mirror in the RISC-V
GitHub</a>, which also contains our
backport branches. Note that the main upstream development branch for
GCC is called <code>trunk</code> instead of <code>master</code> because upstream uses
subversion.</li>
<li>Our glibc port lives in the <a href="https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git">sourceware.org git
repository</a>.<br /></li>
</ul>
<p>The development flow for these projects is pretty straightforward: our
ports are upstream and largely complete, and we do the vast majority of
our development directly on the upstream master branches.  As such, you
should really be able to expect to use the main development branches
(either <code>master</code> or <code>trunk</code>) of all these repositories together and end
up with a working system &ndash; or at least as working as you can expect
when mixing together a bunch of development branches.</p>
<p>Despite the vast majority of the RISC-V ports of the various toolchain
repositories already having been merged upstream there&#x27;s still a lot of
work that remains to be done. The work falls into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for new RISC-V ISAs. This includes the E base ISA everywhere,
the RV32I base ISA in glibc, and future ISAs like the V and J ISAs.
This is very extensive toolchain work so it&#x27;s probably not a good
place to get started.</li>
<li>Support for new features and performance optimizations. Examples here
would be GCC tunings, better linker relaxation and optimized glibc
string routines. Some projects in here are good places to get
started, but we generally need to have good benchmarks in order to
demonstrate that an optimization actually helps.</li>
<li>Fixes for bugs in our toolchain. Our test suite results are pretty
good, so most of the bugs we find here will probably come from
bringing up the RISC-V ports of various distributions. This is the
best place to get started if you&#x27;re interested in contributing to the
RISC-V toolchain effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is more information on how to get involved with the distribution
porting effort below.</p>
<h4 id="gdb">GDB</h2>
<p>The RISC-V GDB port languished for a little while, but Andrew Burgess
from Embecosm recently took over the port and progress has been rapid.
Andrew submitted a patch to add RISC-V support to GDB last week, so
hopefully we will soon be merged upstream, at which point we can treat
our GDB port like a first-class member of the RISC-V software ecosystem!</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re interested in contributing to the RISC-V GDB port then it&#x27;s
probably best to hop on the code review process and help out directly
upstream.</p>
<h4 id="qemu">QEMU</h2>
<p>Michael Clark has taken over as the primary maintainer of the RISC-V
QEMU port since coming on board at SiFive. Over the past few months
he&#x27;s managed to get QEMU up to the latest ISA specifications, fix a
whole bunch of bugs, add new device models, and submit the code upstream
for review multiple times.  We&#x27;re getting close to having something
that&#x27;s suitable for merging upstream, so hopefully we&#x27;ll make the next
release.</p>
<p>Much like GDB, if you&#x27;re interested in helping out with QEMU then it&#x27;s
probably best to help out with the code review process and work directly
upstream.</p>
<h4 id="linux">Linux</h2>
<p>Linux 4.15, released toward the beginning of February, was the first
upstream release that supported RISC-V. While this was a major
milestone for RISC-V, there&#x27;s still a long way to go when it comes to
getting a full Linux-based system up and running &ndash; essentially it boils
down to missing device drivers, but we&#x27;re missing drivers for every
device so you really can&#x27;t do much at all. Before we get into how to
help bringing up our devices, it&#x27;s important to have some base knowledge
about how the Linux development process works &ndash; it&#x27;s a little more
complicated in Linux-land than in GNU-land because Linux releases more
frequently and, as a result, has a more distributed development process.</p>
<p>Linux development is much less centralized than the development of the
GNU toolchain, and is probably much less centralized than any project
you&#x27;re used to. In most projects, there is a canonical repository (maybe
git or subversion) that contains the source code, and a set of
developers that have write (or commit) access to that repository. Linux
works a bit differently: there&#x27;s one public git repo that contains the
canonical Linux source code, but only Linus has write access to that
repository. Instead of allowing contributors to write directly to that
repository, they&#x27;re expected to work in their own public git repository
and submit pull requests to Linus. While this distributed model was
really how git was designed to work, it&#x27;s an uncommon development flow,
so if you&#x27;re not familiar with it then you might want to read up a bit
on the Linux development flow. There are four repositories that are
relevant for the RISC-V development flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/">kernel.org&#x2F;torvalds&#x2F;linux.git</a>:
The canonical Linux tree. The master branch on this repository is
where releases come from, so it really defines Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/palmer/riscv-linux.git/">kernel.org&#x2F;palmer&#x2F;riscv-linux.git</a>:
The RISC-V development tree. This tree owns everything under
<code>arch&#x2F;riscv</code> and is where RISC-V specific pull requests come from.
There are four branches in this tree, listed here in order of
stability:
    <em> <code>master</code>: a copy of Linus&#x27; master, up to the latest RC.
<br /></em> <code>for-linus</code>: the RISC-V branch that&#x27;s pulled into Linus&#x27;
      <code>master</code> branch.  Code in here is meant to be of the highest
      quality, as it generally goes into <code>master</code> a few days after it
      goes into <code>for-linus</code>.
    <em> <code>for-next</code>: the RISC-V branch that&#x27;s pulled into <code>linux-next</code>.
      This follows the standard <code>linux-next</code> rules, so it only
      contains code that&#x27;s been reviewed and is essentially ready to
      go. All commits that go into <code>for-linus</code> must go through
      <code>for-next</code> first.
<br /></em> <code>riscv-all</code>: the RISC-V integration branch, which contains all
      work-in-progress patches. Since this tree contains
      work-in-progress patches, it might not even compile, but as we
      start to get more of our code upstream I hope to make this a
      fairly stable branch.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/palmer/linux.git/">kernel.org&#x2F;palmer&#x2F;linux.git</a>:
My personal Linux development tree. This contains the
work-in-progress patches that I&#x27;ve picked up (and will eventually
clean up and submit upstream) at various stages of development.
Branches from this repository are automatically merged together to
form <code>for-next</code> and <code>riscv-all</code> in the canonical RISC-V repository,
and are eventually submitted to Linus.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-linux.git">github.com&#x2F;riscv&#x2F;riscv-linux.git</a>:
The old RISC-V development tree. This is largely defunct, but I still
monitor pull requests in here and move them through the Linux kernel
development flow.  If you&#x27;re most comfortable with using GitHub for
development, then feel free to us this, but, if, you like use the
standard Linux development flows </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these repositories we have
<a href="http://lists.infradead.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-riscv">linux-riscv@lists.infradead.org</a>
and <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?randomnick=1&channels=%23linux-riscv&prompt=1&uio=d4">#linux-riscv on
freenode</a>.</p>
<h4 id="other-projects">Other Projects</h2>
<p>In addition to the projects that I&#x27;m directly involved with, there are a
handful of other projects that have RISC-V support upstream.  While I&#x27;m
not an expert in how their development flows work, I thought it would be
good to provide at least a quick overview of where development happens
for other RISC-V projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>FreeBSD has a RISC-V port, and the <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/riscv">wiki
page</a> appears to be high quality so
it&#x27;s probably the best place to start.</li>
<li>LLVM has a RISC-V port, which is led by Alex Bradbury from lowRISC.
They have a <a href="http://www.lowrisc.org/llvm/status/">status page</a>, but I&#x27;m
not sure it&#x27;s up to date, as the last update appears to be from
September 2017. One specific item to note is that the RISC-V GitHub
organization has an LLVM repo, but that&#x27;s unrelated to the real RISC-V
LLVM port.</li>
<li>Go has a RISC-V port that is being maintained out-of-tree on a <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-go">RISC-V
GitHub repository</a>. I&#x27;m not sure
what the status is.</li>
<li>The beginnings of an OpenJDK port exist, but it&#x27;s currently limited to
mailing list posts. An <a href="https://content.riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Tue1412-riscv-java-2017-export.pdf">out-of-tree
implementation</a>
from Berkeley exists as well, at least as a slide set :).</li>
<li>Newlib has RISC-V port that has been upstream for a while and has been
released as a tarball. Kito Cheng maintains this port, along with
some help from Jim Wilson at SiFive. Development for newlib happens
upstream, and there&#x27;s a <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-newlib">RISC-V GitHub
repository</a> that contains
various backport branches and work-in-progress features.</li>
<li>Coreboot has a RISC-V port, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much new
content on their <a href="https://blogs.coreboot.org/blog/tag/risc-v/">blog</a>
about the RISC-V port. Jonathan Neuschäfer is in charge of the port.</li>
<li>OpenEmbedded has the beginnings of a port for RISC-V, which is being
led by Khem Raj. As far as I know, the most up-to-date RISC-V support
lives on <a href="https://github.com/kraj/meta-riscv">Khem&#x27;s GitHub
Repository</a>. There is also some
amount of support merged into upstream OpenEmbedded, see the relevant
<a href="http://lists.openembedded.org/pipermail/openembedded-core/2017-October/143072.html">pull
request</a>.</li>
<li>OpenWRT has an on-going RISC-V port, which is being led by Zoltan
Herapi. I&#x27;m not sure where to find more information about this port.</li>
<li>Debian has a RISC-V port in progress, and there&#x27;s a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/RISC-V">wiki
page</a> that describes the port and
contains a progress log.</li>
<li>Fedora has an on-going RISC-V port, which is in the bootstrap phase
now. While I haven&#x27;t used it personally, Jim has used it and it works
for him. They have extensive information on their <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/RISC-V">wiki
page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your favorite project isn&#x27;t listed here, then I&#x27;ve either managed to
forget about it or there isn&#x27;t a port going on right now. The best way
to find all RISC-V software developers is to post on the the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/groups.riscv.org/forum/#!forum/sw-dev">software
development mailing
list</a>,
or to hop into <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net?randomnick=1&channels=%23riscv&prompt=1&uio=d4">#riscv on
freenode</a>.</p>

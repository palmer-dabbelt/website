I am currently employed at Google.  While at SiFive I will be managing the
RISC-V ports of various open source projects.  In addition to my work at
Googel, I currently maintain binutils, GCC, Linux, glibc, and QEMU
RISC-V ports.

My [calendar](calendar.html) is available online and is generally kept
up-to-date.  Blue events signify that I need to be in the office, so I
might need some time to get around.  If you would like to schedule a
meeting then feel free to use the Calendly chooser.

I can be reached by
[email](mailto:palmer+about@dabbelt.com). I've
also uploaded my [resume](resume.pdf), but since I'm not currently
looking for a job it's probably fairly out of date.  My [GPG
key](palmer-dabbelt.gpg) is also available.

![A photo of me](assets/me.jpeg)

I am currently employed at Google, where I work on the Android team.  In
addition, I currently maintain binutils, GCC, Linux, QEMU, glibc, and
GDB.  In addition to these software projects, I
wrote the ["All Aboard" blog series](http://sifive.com/blog) while at
SiFive.

My [calendar](calendar.html) is available online and is
generally kept up-to-date.  Green events signify that I need to be in the
office, so I might need some time to get around.  If you would like to schedule
an event, feel free to just pick a time and send me an email.  I also
publish a [list of the conferences I'm attending](conferences.html),
which may be more useful if you're looking to meet up.

I can be reached by
[email](mailto:palmer+about@dabbelt.com). I've
also uploaded my [resume](resume.pdf), but since I'm not currently
looking for a job it's probably fairly out of date.  My [GPG
key](palmer-dabbelt.gpg) is also available.

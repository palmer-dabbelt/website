I am currently employed at SiFive.  While at SiFive I will be managing the
RISC-V ports of various open source projects.  I currently maintain binutils
and GCC, and I am in the process of submitting Linux and glibc ports (which I
have offered to maintain).  In addition to these software projects, I
write the ["All Aboard" blog series](http://sifive.com/blog).

My [calendar](calendar.html) is available online and is
generally kept up-to-date.  Green events signify that I need to be in the
office, so I might need some time to get around.  If you would like to schedule
an event, feel free to just pick a time and send me an email.

I can be reached by
[email](mailto:palmer+about@dabbelt.com). I've
also uploaded my [resume](resume.pdf), but since I'm not currently
looking for a job it's probably fairly out of date.  My [GPG
key](palmer-dabbelt.gpg) is also available.

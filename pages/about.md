![A photo of me](assets/me.jpeg)

I am currently employed at SiFive.  While at SiFive I will be managing the
RISC-V ports of various open source projects.  I currently maintain:

* binutils, which has been accepted by upstream for the 2.28 release.

* GCC, which has been accepted by upstream for the 7.1 release.

My [calendar](calendar.html) is availiable online and is
generally kept up-to-date. Unless otherwise specified, blue events are
on campus while all other colors are off campus. I am generally in my
office when I'm on campus, but you should schedule a meeting ahead of
time if possible.

I can be reached by
[email](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01fm-8WTM-kTwRkZd8rLZxmQ==&c=Bu87McGCMC3MvPApw0RqbH1gzipCRUUpLnzplgltk-I=). I've
also uploaded my [resume](resume.pdf), but since I'm not currently
looking for a job it's probably fairly out of date.

If you're looking for me to get something done, then the best way to go about
this is to submit a pull request against my [TODO
list](http://github.com/palmer-dabbelt/home/).


## Projects

Here's a list of the projects I have worked on in the past:

* PLSI: a portable VLSI flow for RTL-based computer architecture research.

* Hurricane: a multicore RISC-V implementation designed for power
  efficient DSP.  This project resulted in a chip on ST's 28nm FDSOI.

* DREAMER, a coarse grained reconfigurable architecture designed for
  high speed circuit emulation. The goal of DREAMER is to reduce the
  time to complete a design cycle down the same order of magnitude as
  software. [2013-2014]

* ChiselCrypt, a generator for cryptographic accelerators. [2013]

* A port of Sun's [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net) to
  [Tilera](http://tilera.com)'s Tile-Gx architecture, including both
  the HotSpot interpreter and C2 (the server JIT). [2012-2013]

* The design and implementation of a real-time background subtraction
  algorithm taking advantage consumer of depth cameras. This research
  spawned [Personify](http://personify.com) (formally Nuvixa). [2009-2010]

## Academic History

I graduated in 2011 from the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) with a B.S. in Electrical and
Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Sanjay
Patel](http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/sjp/) and [Steve
Lumetta](http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/steve/).

I will soon graduate from the
[University of California: Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu) with a M.S in
Computer Science, where I was advised by [Krste
Asanovic](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) and [Jonathan
Bachrach](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrb/).

## Teaching

* I, along with Vedant Kumar, am currently one of two TAs for
  CS194-24: Advanced Operating Systems Structures and Implementation,
  an upper division undergrade operating systems course at UC Berkeley
  during the Spring 2014 semester. This class is being tought by John
  Kubiatowicz.
* I was the sole TA for CS194-24: Advanced Operating Systems
  Structures and Implementation, an upper division undergrade
  operating systems course at UC Berkeley during the Spring 2013
  semester. This class was tought by John Kubiatowicz.
* I was an undergraduate TA for ECE391: Computer Systems Engineering,
  an upper division undergraduate operating systems course at UIUC. I
  was a member of the staff for four semesters, from 2009 to
  2011. This course was tought by Zbigniew Kalbarczyk, Nikita Borisov,
  and Steve Lumetta while I was a TA.

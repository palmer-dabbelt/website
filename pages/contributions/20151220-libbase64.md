------
I copied someone's base64 encode/decode code into MHng.  Since I've been having
some trouble getting attachments to work correctly, I figured it'd be best to
just fix up this code properly (it's probably not a base64 but, but a
NUL-in-string problem).  I went to find a C base64 library, but there wasn't a
packaged one so Google led me to
[libbase64](https://github.com/kisom/libbase64).  This wasn't quite ready to be
packaged, so I've added the following patches:

* 2f19707 Get around an autoconf future-incompatibility <Palmer Dabbelt>
* dd8fe80 Define `_DEFAULT_SOURCE` everywhere <Palmer Dabbelt>
* db21f8c Ignore all the generate build output <Palmer Dabbelt>
* 503ea32 Add libtool, which builds shared libraries <Palmer Dabbelt>
* 9241f19 Install libbase64-1.pc, a pkg-config file <Palmer Dabbelt>
* b97e00b Add C++ 'extern "C"' guards <Palmer Dabbelt>

I opened a [pull request](https://github.com/kisom/libbase64/pull/1), which was merged.

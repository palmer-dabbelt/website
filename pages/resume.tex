\textbf{Projects}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ported the Hotspot JVM (and Sun's OpenJDK) to Tilera's Tile-Gx
  processors.  Our team consisted of two people.  I started mid-way
  through the process, with a functional port of Hotspot's interpreter
  to Tile-Pro (the previous generation of Tilera chips), but I the two
  of us ported Hotspot's interpreter and the C2 server compiler to
  Tile-Gx.
\item Created a superscalar out of order implementation of the LC3b
  processor in VHDL.  The processor has split L1 caches and a unified
  L2 cache.  It uses Tomasulu's algorithm to achieve out of order
  execution.  This was a group project which ended up winning me the
  411 design competiton.
\item Single user cluster operating system using serial interconnects
  for x86.  Written in C and x86 ASM.  In addition, for this project I
  wrote an implementation of packet-switched networking over serial
  ports, a network aware scheduler, synchronization constructs, and an
  implementation of shared memory over the network.  This project won
  me honorable mention in the ECE391 Programming Contest.
\item Created and implemented a real-time video streaming protocol
  over UDP on GNU/Linux.  Written in C.  In addition, I wrote code to
  interface with V4L USB video capture on Linux and code to interface
  with OpenGL on Linux.
\item Created and implemented a real-time background subtraction
  algorithm using depth cameras.  I wrote an implementation using C on
  GNU/Linux and am currently working on an implementation using C++ on
  Win32, which will be commercial quality code.  I have a patent on
  this algorithm.

\item Won ECE411 Design Competiton, Fall 2009
\item Honorable Mention in ECE391 Programming Contest, Spring 2009

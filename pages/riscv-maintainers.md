# Maintainers of RISC-V Software

As RISC-V is still a fairly new ISA, very few projects have been accepted into
the relevant upstream repositories.  This is a bit of a placeholder, hopefully
I'll fix the page up later...

## Ports Accepted by Upstream and Developed on Git Hub

You're always welcome to submit patches or bugs via the normal upstream
mechanism to these projects, as there is an active maintainer of the RISC-V
port.  If you're unfamiliar with the project or feel more comfortable using Git
Hub, you're welcome to also use the RISC-V Git Hub page as some develop

[gcc](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gcc): Palmer Dabbelt, Andrew Waterman, and

## Ports in Submission and Developted on Git Hub

These ports are currently under submission to the upstream maintainers, and
therefor are frequently having patches wrangled.  To stay entirely up to date,
it's best to subscribe the the
[patches@lists.riscv.org](mailto:patches@lists.riscv.org) mailing list as all
discussion should be CC'd there.

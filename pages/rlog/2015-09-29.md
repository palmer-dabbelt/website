PROJECT: Hurricane-0
---------

I was down in the BWRC for the hurricane-0 tape-in work day:

* Some of the AsyncFifo{T,R}X instances failed due to a Chisel width
  inference bug.  The workaround here is to provide the width
  manually.

* Colin verified that the rest of the FIFOs were actually hooked up,
  and fixed those that weren't.

At this point, the tests still didn't actually run.  It turns out that
USE\_BACKUP\_MEM wasn't being dumped into the VH file, so the test
harness wasn't actually instantiating the HTIF magic memory.  The
result was that the top-level backup memory port wasn't being driven,
so the cache could never get a response back from the memory.

There's some things left to do:

* Upstream the USE\_BACKUP\_MEM dump patch to rocket-chip.

* Figure out why some of the tests hang.

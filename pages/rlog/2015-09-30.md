Colin and I looked at the hanging test and we've discovered that we
can modulate the failures by changing the register initialization
value.  After looking through a diff between the good and bad runs, we
think the problem is somehow related to Cassia -- specifically, the
CTRL\_EN input pin isn't ever asserted for core 0 on the bad runs,
which means the clock never starts toggling.

I went to the BWRC to talk to Ben about this, but we ended up in
meetings.

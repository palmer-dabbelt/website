PROJECT: chisel, linux
------
Today was sort of a maintaince day: after being sick all weekend I wanted to
clear out my inbox.  I went and merged a bunch of Chisel pull requests that had
been sitting around.  I also rebased my Linux patches on to 4.3 (which just
worked, shockingly) and am in the process of submitting them.
